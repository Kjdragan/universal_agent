Okay, I'm just trying to run a process wrapper that enables that process to run for even longer with even more multi-step phases put together. So for now, just focus on the underlying execution engine without the harness implementation. As such, I'm giving you an example of a terminal output for a simple non-harness user query, which is run through the execution engine and generates multiple steps to answer the user's request. This is what I'm asking you to facilitate with the web user interface. Mainly to allow for entering the original user query and then also showing all the equivalent terminal output as the agents work through their processes with tool calls and tool call results and final work products and many interim work products that get saved in the agent run workspaces directory and the associated numbered session for it underneath it.he terminal. The harness is just our equivalent normal process to a terminal query. I haven't even done the harness type approach. Take a look at this terminal output from a simple terminal run query. This is what we're trying to emulate in our UI before we even deal with the extra harness issues. So take a look at this process. As you surmised, yes, it is a flow. It needs to follow this flow in order to work through answering the user's request whether the ui is this terminal base or as we try to emulate it in a web based UI:
