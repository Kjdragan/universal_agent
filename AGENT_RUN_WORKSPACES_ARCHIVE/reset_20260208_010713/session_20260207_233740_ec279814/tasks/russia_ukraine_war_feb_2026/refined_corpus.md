*   **FGM Theme and Investment:** The 2026 International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (February 6) utilizes the theme “Towards 2030: No end to FGM without sustained commitment and investment,” emphasizing that ending the practice by 2030 requires continuous global engagement and funding.
*   **Nature Finance Gap:** A United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report warns that for every US$1 invested in protecting nature, US$30 goes to activities that harm it; in 2023, nature-negative finance flows reached US$7.3 trillion, driven by the private sector and US$2.4 trillion in harmful public subsidies.
*   **Preventable Cancer Data:** New World Health Organization (WHO) findings reveal that up to 40% of global cancer cases are preventable; an estimated 37% of new cases in 2022 (7.1 million) were linked to preventable causes, with tobacco (15%), infections (10%), and alcohol (3%) being the leading risk factors.
*   **Sudan Displacement Crisis:** Nearly three years into the conflict, over 3 million Sudanese have returned to their home areas, which often suffer from extensive housing damage and destroyed infrastructure; IOM teams are responding with shelter, water, and basic services.
*   **FGM Legal Framework:** Ending female genital mutilation requires survivor-centred justice that goes beyond laws to include healing, support, accountability, and changing enabling social attitudes.
*   **Cancer Types:** Lung, stomach, and cervical cancers comprised nearly half of preventable cases, with smoking and air pollution identified as primary contributors to lung cancer.
*   **Syrian Humanitarian Crisis:** Pregnant and displaced women in northern Syria face life-threatening risks as violence and winter collapse homes, safety, and access to healthcare.
*   **Featured Individual - Shakira:** Shakira, an FGM survivor and champion, is featured (photo © UNFPA Ethiopia) as part of the campaign to share voices using #Invest2EndFGM and #EndFGM.
*   **Featured Individual - Maw Maw Hmwe:** In Myanmar's Magway Region, Maw Maw Hmwe, a mother of eight, joined a women's savings and credit group supported by the FAO in 2024 to access low-interest loans for rice farming, gaining financial independence and community support despite climate and political crises.

### Ukraine is leading a military revolution but needs more Western support - Atlantic Council
**Source:** atlanticcouncil.org, 2026-01-30

*   **Current Military Status:** Ukraine's new Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov confirmed in January 2026 that around 200,000 soldiers are absent without leave (AWOL), with a further two million men accused of avoiding military service.
*   **Russian Gains:** Despite enjoying the initiative throughout 2025, Russia captured less than one percent of Ukraine's territory, though they are currently advancing and causing prolonged blackouts in Ukrainian cities.
*   **Military Revolution Thesis:** The article argues Ukraine is at the epicenter of a "revolution in military affairs" based on inexpensive, highly accurate drones and cruise missiles, drawing parallels to the Dutch revolt against Spain in the 16th century.
*   **Historical Comparison:** Just as the Dutch used cheap iron cannons (one-tenth the cost of bronze) and earth/timber fortifications to defeat the Spanish superpower, Ukraine is democratizing long-range strike technologies previously only affordable to wealthy states.
*   **Innovation Ecosystem:** Ukraine's unique defense ecosystem—fueled by the existential war, software engineers, and pluralistic funding—has swept away bureaucratic barriers, creating an environment more akin to Silicon Valley than traditional military-industrial complexes.
*   **Strategic Requirement:** Ukraine currently lacks the resources to fund production at scale, but companies have spare capacity; the article argues that financing additional output by partners is necessary to regain the initiative.
*   **Operational Impact:** Increased volumes of long-range strike weapons can create an operational depth stretching hundreds of kilometers behind Russian lines, where infantry and armored units are ineffective without supplies.
*   **Sanctions Synergy:** A combined policy of tightening sanctions on Russian energy exports and escalating Ukrainian strikes on refineries and pipelines can seriously damage the Russian oil and gas industry.
*   **Peklo Drone Specs:** The Peklo (Hell) missile drone, displayed in Kyiv in December 2024, has a strike range of 700 km, a speed of 700 km/h, and has already seen five successful uses; it is now in serial production.
*   **Economic Pressure:** Unsustainable Russian military spending is described as an "economic time bomb" for the Putin regime.
*   **Forecast:** With sufficient support, this military revolution offers a viable pathway to Russia's battlefield defeat and an acceptable peace agreement, rather than forcing Ukraine to accept a Kremlin-friendly agreement.
*   **Author:** Dr. Marc De Vore, a senior lecturer at the University of St. Andrews, authored the analysis.

### Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, February 2, 2026 | Critical Threats
**Source:** criticalthreats.org, 2026-02-02

*   **Medvedev Statements:** Russian Security Council Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev reaffirmed that demands for Ukraine remain unchanged, rejected security guarantees, and used nuclear threats likely to distract from or secure concessions during US-led peace talks.
*   **Northern Axis Activity:** Russian forces continued offensive operations in northern Sumy Oblast on February 2 but did not make confirmed advances; they also recently advanced in northern Kharkiv Oblast and the Kupyansk direction.
*   **Fortress Belt Assessment:** ISW assesses that Russian forces are at least several months away from being able to begin a ground offensive against Ukraine’s Fortress Belt from the north or east, partly due to Ukrainian counterattacks near Kupyansk.
*   **Donetsk Advances:** Russian forces recently advanced in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area, the Pokrovsk direction, and the Hulyaipole direction (infiltration), while continuing offensive operations in Slovyansk and Oleksandrivka without confirmed advances.
*   **Starlink Countermeasures:** The Ukrainian government is working with SpaceX to prohibit all non-registered Starlink satellite terminals from operating in Ukraine to counter Russia's use of the system for operating drones.
*   **Belarus Activity:** Belarus continues to increase the frequency of its balloon incursions into Polish airspace.
*   **Strategic Objectives:** The Russian main effort remains focused on Eastern Ukraine (Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk), with supporting efforts in the north (buffer zones in Sumy) and south (securing rear areas, approaching Zaporizhzhia).
*   **Methodology:** ISW uses publicly available information, commercial satellite imagery, and social media, and does not report in detail on war crimes unless they affect military operations.
*   **Frontline Status:** Neither Ukrainian nor Russian sources reported ground activity in the Kherson direction on February 1 or 2.

*   **Druzhkivka Situation:** A November 2025 visit to Druzhkivka (Donetska Oblast) revealed a "ghost town" with utter destruction, where residents live under strict curfews, shelling patterns, and face the choice of fleeing or enduring unendurable conditions.
*   **2026 Strategic Targets:** With an estimated 10.8 million people in need, humanitarians aim to reach 4.1 million of the most vulnerable, prioritizing those near the front line, the newly displaced, those affected by strikes, and IDPs at risk of exclusion.
*   **Evolution of Warfare:** The war is evolving with increased drone and long-range strikes causing systematic damage to energy and water services, while front-line villages are being "hollowed out."
*   **Aid Worker Safety:** 2025 was devastating for humanitarian workers, with eight killed (four on duty) and 47 injured in attacks that also damaged aid assets; 2026 is expected to be equally unsafe.
*   **Long-term Impact:** The war's impact will outlive the emergency phase, necessitating a shift toward development solutions for 3.7 million IDPs (e.g., housing, employment) and survivors of conflict-related sexual violence.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Due to shrinking humanitarian resources, the plan adopts an issue-based approach with four strategic priorities to make deliberate choices about supporting those most at risk.
*   **Localization:** Local organizations deliver most of the work; the Humanitarian Country Team prioritizes the localization agenda and accountability to affected people beyond just complaint mechanisms.
*   **Call to Action:** The plan urges donors to sustain flexible, predictable funding to respond to shocks while maintaining essential services, emphasizing that principled humanitarian action must be distinct from development efforts.
*   **Mental Health:** The mental health consequences for adults, children, and former combatants will shape Ukrainian society for years.

### Ukraine Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan 2026 (January 2026) [EN/UK] | OCHA
**Source:** unocha.org, **Date:** unknown

*   The report describes a "humanitarian catastrophe" in Druzhkivka (Donetska Oblast), a town formerly of tens of thousands now reduced to a "ghost town" with flattened homes and civilian infrastructure.
*   Almost 4 years after the full-scale invasion, humanitarian needs have deepened rather than decreased, with evolving warfare (drone attacks, long-range strikes) causing systematic damage to energy and water services.
*   Civilians in front-line towns face strict curfews, allowing them outside only a few hours a day, and must time their lives around shelling patterns and drone attack risks.
*   2025 was devastating for aid workers: eight colleagues were killed (four on duty) and 47 injured in attacks that also damaged evacuation vehicles, warehouses, and aid trucks.
*   The situation of over **3.7 million internally displaced people (IDPs)** requires a shift from emergency relief to durable development solutions for housing and employment as the war approaches its fifth year.
*   The 2026 Plan targets **10.8 million people** in need, with humanitarians aiming to reach **4.1 million** of the most vulnerable due to finite funding and capacity.
*   The Plan adopts an issue-based approach with four strategic priorities, focusing on those near the front line, the newly displaced, those affected by strikes, and at-risk IDPs.
*   The crisis remains a "protection crisis" at its core, with the elderly, disabled, single parents, and chronically ill being the most affected.
*   Long-term consequences identified include severe mental health impacts on civilians and combatants, strain on education/health systems, and fractures in social cohesion.
*   Local organizations are credited with delivering the majority of humanitarian work at great personal risk, driving an increasingly localized response.

### ‘Energy truce’ could be preamble to Ukraine peace deal – Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO)
**Source:** prio.org, 2026-01-25

*   Analyst Pavel K. Baev suggests the "energy truce"—a pause on attacks on energy infrastructure—fits the pattern of Russian strikes where a massive attack is followed by days of lower-intensity drone assaults.
*   The ceasefire comes as Ukraine’s grid, already "catastrophically" damaged, suffered a major blackout during the truce.
*   A new diplomatic format has emerged, featuring a Russian delegation led by Admiral Igor Kostyikov (Director of the Main Intelligence Directorate and deputy to Valery Gerasimov), while the US team returned to Miami to meet with Kirill Dmitriev.
*   Mainstream Russian media were initially skeptical of the truce until Putin granted his approval.
*   The primary obstacle in negotiations remains Putin's demand for control over the entirety of Ukraine’s Donetsk oblast; Russian commentators view Zelenskyy’s refusal as "sabotage."
*   Zelenskyy prioritizes security guarantees provided by a European stabilization force with strong US support over holding the specific territories in Donetsk.
*   The Russian Foreign Ministry, excluded from the talks by Putin, has issued statements condemning the deployment of NATO forces in Ukraine.
*   Russian public opinion polls (Levada Center) show a strong preference for ending the war but limited approval for making concessions to Ukraine.
*   Putin may attempt to present a deal gaining control of Donetsk as a victory to distract from the "crippling cost" of the war and the "erosion of Russia’s international prestige."
*   Signs of Russia's diminished global sway include the withdrawal of troops from Syrian bases and irrelevance in managing the crisis in Iran.
*   Russia’s economy is "deformed" by the war, and the Kremlin’s ability to fund the war effort is highly uncertain without external investment.

### Ukraine, Russia end second round of peace talks with agreement on prisoner swap, new meeting
**Source:** reuters.com, 2026-02-05

*   Ukraine and Russia concluded a second round of US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, resulting in a major prisoner swap involving 314 prisoners of war (157 each).

*   US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff stated the discussions were "constructive and focused on how to create the conditions for a durable peace."
*   The next round of talks is expected to be held soon, likely in the United States.
*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated the need for "robust security guarantees" from Washington to ensure Russia does not attack again.
*   US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that further sanctions on Russia would depend on the progress of the talks, while maintaining his view that Putin is a "war criminal."
*   Russia’s envoy Kirill Dmitriev reported progress and indicated work is underway to restore US-Russia relations, including via a working group on the economy.
*   Zelenskyy disclosed that approximately 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the nearly four-year war.

*   Despite the talks, Russia launched major airstrikes on Ukraine overnight on Tuesday and smaller drone attacks later in the week.
*   Ukrainian forces struck a testing ground for Russia's Oreshnik hypersonic missiles near the Caspian Sea using Ukrainian-made long-range "Flamingo" missiles.
*   Territorial disputes remain unresolved, with Moscow demanding Kyiv pull troops from the entire Donetsk region, while Ukraine insists on freezing the conflict along current front lines.
*   Ukraine demands control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (Europe's largest), while Russia insists it must remain Russian.

*   Medvedev utilized nuclear threats ("carrots and sticks") in an apparent attempt to secure concessions during US-led peace negotiations.
*   Medvedev implicitly threatened Finland regarding the dismantling of Russian-Finnish relations and threatened Russians who do not support the war efforts.
*   The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assesses that Russian forces are at least several months away from being able to begin a ground offensive against Ukraine’s "Fortress Belt" from the north or east.
*   The Ukrainian government is collaborating with SpaceX to prohibit unregistered Starlink terminals to counter Russia's use of the system for operating drones.
*   Belarus has increased the frequency of balloon incursions into Polish airspace.
*   Russian forces recently advanced in northern Kharkiv Oblast, the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area, and near Kupyansk, Pokrovsk, and Hulyaipole.
*   Russian offensive operations continued in the Slovyansk direction without confirmed advances.
