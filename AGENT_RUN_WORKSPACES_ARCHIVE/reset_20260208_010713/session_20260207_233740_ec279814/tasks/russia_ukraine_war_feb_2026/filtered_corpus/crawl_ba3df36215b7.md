This war is different. Although men and machines are also clashing in this one, the global public can this time follow the developments in nearly real time, unlike in past conflicts. At the NZZ, too, we are using the flood of information reaching us from Ukraine to give you the most up-to-date picture of the situation possible. Our interactive map above depicts recent events, territorial gains and losses, satellite imagery, and the position of Russian troops. It is an attempt to map the reality of war.
However, reality is always more complex than what can be represented on a map. Maps always show only a certain point of view, and can only approximate reality. Therefore, we want to be clear here about how our map has been created, so readers can understand what it says and what it does not.
The short answer: anything relevant to understanding the war that we have been able to verify. The detailed answer, on the other hand, is more complex and – because war is constantly changing – in a constant state of flux.
«Relevant» to us means, for example, the locations in which combat operations are taking place; or strategically important targets that have been attacked or captured such as airports, power plants, transmission towers or bridges. We do not report the destruction of individual buildings unless the attack has symbolic value or has claimed an exceptionally large number of victims. For example: In the embattled city of Mariupol, a theater with hundreds of civilians sheltering in its basements was destroyed.
We do not show deaths, events that serve (Russian or Ukrainian) propaganda, or those that violate international law. For example, we do not show pictures in which captured soldiers are recognizable.

We record on the map only those attacks that we have been able to substantiate through multiple independent sources. Our sources include Twitter, Facebook, Telegram and news agencies. We also include communications from local authorities in our research, but we treat this information with caution.
We check every picture and video to see if it was taken at the specified location and if the specified time is plausible. For verification purposes we refer to satellite images or Google Street View images, but we also rely on other reliable research networks (such as Bellingcat) or private persons (so-called Osint specialists, more about this here).
» Read more about how Osint experts verify events.» Read more about how you can recognize fake news on social media yourself.
We collect current news on a daily basis, even on weekends. In some cases, we are aware of events shortly after they occur, but are unable to verify them until the following day, using further material.
There is no official information from the Ukrainian or Russian side regarding which areas are under whose control. And if such information was provided, it would not be reliable. Maps have always been misused for political purposes (China, for example, depicts maritime areas as belonging to China in order to strengthen its claim to them).
At the same time, the nature of warfare has also changed. Attackers do not drive across forests and meadows with a broad front, seeking to annex square meter after square meter, as they did in World War II, for example. Instead, combat operations focus on strategically important roads, cities and facilities. Maps showing large areas held by Russian troops therefore often do not represent the actual influence of a warring party.
This is illustrated by the following example. The first map is from the Ukrainian organization Liveuamap (more on that later). Instead of entire areas, the creators often mark only individual streets as being held by Russian troops. Information provided by the American Institute for the Study of War appears to show far greater Russian successes for the same day. On the latest map published by Russian newspaper Readovka, areas marked in color as the «war zone» give the impression that large parts of eastern Ukraine are under Russian control.
For our map we use data from Liveuamap. This organization emerged in 2014 in Ukraine during the annexation of Crimea. Since then, the staff has dealt with various conflicts both in and outside Europe. The NZZ has also relied on its data for other conflicts.
We rely on information from Henry Schlottman, a former U.S. Army analyst. Using known troop positions before the war began, pictures of (destroyed) Russian war equipment, information from prisoners and other public data, he is able to record the approximate position of each unit. Despite all this information, the data remain approximations.
The Russian army relies on so-called battalion tactical groups (BTGs). A BTG consists of various individual units and is capable of performing tasks without additional support. It is a central organizational unit in the Russian army and typically consists of infantry, tank companies, artillery, air defense, logistics and other support units, for example.
Yes, the map is constantly being adapted and expanded to meet changing needs. We will also update this article on an ongoing basis.
