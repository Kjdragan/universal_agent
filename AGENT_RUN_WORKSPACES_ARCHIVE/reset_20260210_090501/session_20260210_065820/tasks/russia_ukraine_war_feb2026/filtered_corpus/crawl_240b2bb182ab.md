**Russian Security Council Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev used a three-way interview with Western and Russian newswires and an ultranationalist milblogger to reaffirm that Russia’s demands for Ukraine "remain unchanged" and to reject security guarantees for Ukraine.** Medvedev gave an interview on February 1 to Reuters, Kremlin newswire TASS, and pro-war Russian milblogger and head of the WarGonzo social media military project Semyon Pegov.[[1]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0661>) Medvedev stated that Russian demands for ending the war in Ukraine "remain unchanged" and that Russian President Vladimir Putin voiced these conditions during his June 2024 speech to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). Medvedev also stated that Putin relayed these conditions to the United States at the August 2025 US-Russia Alaska Summit. Putin demanded in his June 2024 speech that Ukraine and NATO capitulate to Russia’s original war demands and cede the illegally annexed Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts — including unoccupied areas of these regions.[[2]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0662>) Russia's original war demands include Ukraine’s neutrality (the Kremlin's ability to dictate Ukraine’s international alignment), demilitarization (reductions in the Ukrainian military such that Ukraine cannot defend itself), and denazification (the replacement of the current Ukrainian government with a pro-Russian puppet government). Medvedev also stated that Russia considers the “dismantling” of the Ukrainian government to be an “extremely important task” and that the current Ukrainian government “must disappear.” Medvedev questioned the legitimacy of the current Ukrainian government and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Kremlin officials have repeatedly exploited the lack of clarity about the outcome of the 2025 Alaska Summit, including by claiming that the United States and Russia agreed to principles based on Putin’s June 2024 MFA speech during the summit.[[3]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0663>)
Medvedev explicitly rejected proposals from the British and French-led Coalition of the Willing to station foreign troops on Ukrainian territory as part of postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.[[4]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0664>) Medvedev recalled that Putin, Medvedev, and Lavrov have all publicly stated that Russia does not accept such proposals and would consider troops from NATO countries as “legitimate targets.” Medvedev also demanded that Russia receive security guarantees. The Kremlin originally demanded "security guarantees" in its December 2021 ultimatums to the United States and NATO, which amounted to the destruction of the current NATO alliance by calling for halting the deployment of forces or weapons systems to member states that joined NATO after 1997.[[5]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0665>) Medvedev likely deliberately participated in the three-way interview with Reuters, TASS, and Pegov in an effort to disseminate Russia's demands across Russian domestic and ultranationalist audiences, English-speaking outlets, and international media.
**Medvedev continued to use nuclear carrots and sticks, likely in an attempt to distract attention from and secure concessions during US-led peace negotiations on Ukraine.** Medvedev stated in the interview that Russia's proposal to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which expires on February 5, remains on the table for the United States to agree to.[[6]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0666>) Putin previously offered to adhere to the terms of New START for another year upon its expiration, but only if the United States does the same.[[7]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0667>) Medvedev claimed in the interview that the risk of a global conflict is high and that the "Doomsday Clock" is moving forward. Medvedev referenced Russia’s updated nuclear doctrine, stating that “no one should have any doubts” about Russia’s willingness to use nuclear weapons if the fate of Russia is at stake. Medvedev’s mix of thinly veiled nuclear threats and comments offering to engage the United States on nuclear arms treaties aims to use issues unrelated to Russia’s war in Ukraine to push the United States into giving in to Russia’s demands on Ukraine — as ISW has long assessed.[[8]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0668>)
**Medvedev implicitly threatened and accused Finland of dismantling Russian-Finnish relations.** Medvedev claimed that Finland “wiped” out the positive Russian-Finnish relations that emerged after the Soviet Union collapsed. Medvedev issued a subtle threat, claiming that Finland has forgotten how the Soviet Union “crushed” Finland when it was a Nazi ally and that Finland should not joke about its relations with Russia as the 20th-century conflicts were not in Finland’s “favor.” Medvedev referenced Finland’s historical ties to the Soviet Union and Russia, claiming that Finland should “thank” Vladimir Lenin — likely referring to Lenin’s 1917 recognition of Finland’s independence. Putin and other Russian officials have previously threatened Finland, including by using language that mirrors Russia’s justifications for its invasion of Ukraine to Finland.[[9]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf0669>) Russian officials’ narratives about Finland have long invoked historic Finnish-Russian ties and Finland’s history as a Nazi ally during the Second World War.[[10]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06610>) These threats come as Russia is expanding its military infrastructure along its border with Finland, likely as part of wider military expansion efforts that seek to prepare Russia for potential future conflict with NATO.[[11]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06611>) **ISW continues to assess that Russia remains unlikely to conduct a full-scale invasion of Finland at this time and that Medvedev's statements are likely part of the Kremlin's long-term cognitive warfare campaign to create justifications for a possible conflict with NATO in the future.**
**Medvedev subtly threatened Russians who do not support Russia's war efforts in Ukraine and possibly against NATO.** Medvedev responded to a question from TASS by claiming that Western states, particularly those in Europe, are Russia’s enemies who want to defeat and destroy Russia.[[12]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06612>) Medvedev directly compared the ongoing war against Ukraine to the Second World War, claiming that Russia, like the Soviet Union, is defending the state and the Russian people. Medvedev further claimed that those in Russia who are indifferent to Russian soldiers on the front, who are unwilling to help their own state, and who “lack basic patriotism” are Russia’s “internal enemies.” The Kremlin has often used the mythos of the Second World War to glorify the Russian military and unify the Russian people around the ongoing war effort in Ukraine.[[13]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06613>) Medvedev's statements about external enemies and the Second World War aim to justify to the Russian population the sacrifices the Kremlin has been demanding of them and the need to maintain a war footing for the protracted war in Ukraine or even a possible conflict with NATO in the future. Medvedev’s statements about internal enemies likely aim to threaten those Russians who either oppose the war or the Kremlin itself, and to evoke memories of the Soviet-era “enemies of the people” to set a behavioral standard the Kremlin expects all Russians to adhere to. ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin is transforming Russia into a Soviet-style police state, likely in preparation for expected anti-war sentiment in the Russian population, and continued Kremlin discussion about alleged internal enemies aim to justify these increased repressions.[[14]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06614>)
**Russian forces continue efforts to seize Lyman and subsequently launch an offensive on Slovyansk, but likely do not have the offensive capability to do so in the short-term, in part due to Ukrainian counterattacks in the Kupyansk direction.** Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets reported on February 2 that the main objective of the Russian Western Grouping of Forces in the Lyman direction is to reach the Slovyansk-Kramatorsk agglomeration from the northeast, and that the Russian military command hopes to begin this offensive in May or June 2026.[[16]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06616>) Mashovets reported that Russian forces - namely elements of the 20th Combined Arms Army (CAA, Moscow Military District [MMD]), 25th CAA (Central Military District [CMD]), and the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army [GTA], MMD) -- must first seize Lyman and push Ukrainian forces from the north (left) bank of the Siverskyi Donets River in the area. Mashovets assessed that the Russian military command aims to do so by mid-to-late Spring 2026. Mashovets stated that the current Russian offensive operations, including attacks with elements of the 25th CAA from the northwest and with elements of the 20th CAA from the east and northeast, aim to establish favorable positions for a future effort to envelop Lyman.
Russian forces remain unlikely to meet their Spring 2026 deadlines for the Slovyansk direction without receiving additional reinforcements or deprioritizing the Kupyansk offensive. Russian forces first reached Lyman in November 2025 following intensified offensive operations in the area, but have been unable to build on these successes and make tactically significant advances near or within Lyman itself in the following months.[[17]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06617>) The 20th CAA has been operating in the Lyman direction since at least September 2022, and the 25th CAA has been in the area since October 2023.[[18]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06618>) ISW observed reports of elements of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division operating in the Lyman direction since at least April 2025.[[19]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06619>) These forces are likely degraded and unlikely to achieve the Russian military command's reported timeline without significant reinforcement. Mashovets stated that the Russian Western Grouping of Forces is unlikely to be able to use its reserves in the Lyman area, as Russian forces are currently using all available reserves in the Kupyansk direction. Mashovets assessed that the Russian military command may have to redeploy elements of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division to the Kupyansk direction in the future — presumably to defend against the ongoing Ukrainian counterattacks that have successfully liberated most of Kupyansk and the surrounding areas. Mashovets noted that the reserves of the Western Grouping of Forces have deployed to the Kupyansk direction to defend against these counterattacks, leaving them unavailable to bolster offensive operations in the Lyman direction.[[20]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06620>)
**ISW continues to assess that Russian forces are at least several months away from being able to begin a ground offensive against Ukraine’s Fortress Belt from the north or east.** Russian forces would need to complete the seizure of Lyman and advance 14 kilometers from Lyman to Slovyansk (including crossing the Siverskyi Donets River) or would need to traverse 30 kilometers from Siversk (east of Slovyansk) to Slovyansk.[[21]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06621>) Elements of the Russian 3rd CAA (formerly 2nd Luhansk People's Republic Army Corps [LNR AC], Southern Military District [SMD]) operating in the Siversk direction may launch a direct offensive against Slovyansk from the east should they make the requisite advances before the 20th and 25th CAAs can seize Lyman and reach the Siverskyi Donets River. Russian forces in the Lyman direction have been attempting to use Russia’s new offensive campaign design, which consists of an initial monthslong effort to degrade Ukrainian defenses and logistics to forward positions ahead of ground operations.[[22]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06622>) Russian forces were able to employ this new campaign design to make relatively quicker advances in the Pokrovsk and Hulyaipole directions, but the slow rate of Russian advances near and within Lyman suggests that Russian forces have so far not been able to completely degrade Ukrainian defenses in the area.[[23]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06623>) Russian forces would likely have to dedicate significant resources, including infantry and drone operators, to the Lyman direction in order to achieve their desired rate of advance, but this would come at the expense of other areas in the theater, such as offensive operations to complete the seizure of Pokrovsk or defensive operations in the Kupyansk direction.[[24]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06624>) The Kremlin has been attempting for months to convince the West that Russia’s seizure of the Fortress Belt will be easy and swift, but ISW continues to assess that these efforts — either from the south from the Kostyantynivka direction or from the north from the Lyman direction — could take years.[[25]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06625>)
**The Ukrainian government is working with SpaceX to prohibit all non-registered Starlink satellite terminals from operating in Ukraine as part of joint efforts to counter Russia’s use of Starlink to operate drones in Ukraine.** Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov reported on February 2 that the Ukrainian government adopted a resolution to only allow officially registered and verified Starlink terminals to operate in Ukraine and to disconnect all other terminals.[[27]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06627>) Fedorov stated that Russian drones equipped with Starlink terminals fly at low altitudes, are resistant to Ukrainian electronic warfare (EW), and are controllable in real time at long distances. Fedorov noted that the Ukrainian military will register their Starlink terminals and that measures allowing only authorized Starlink terminals to operate in Ukraine will deprive Russian forces of technological advantages and safeguard Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Fedorov did not provide an estimated timeframe on how long individual Ukrainians will have to register and verify their private Starlink terminals. The Ukrainian government has been working recently with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to counter Russia’s use of Starlink.[[28]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06628>)
**Belarus continues to increase the frequency of its balloon incursions into Polish airspace.** The Polish Armed Forces Operational Command reported that Polish radar systems recorded the incursion of “balloon-like objects” into Polish airspace on the night of February 1 to 2.[[29]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06629>) The Polish Armed Forces Operational Command noted that there were fewer balloon violations than on previous nights. Belarus has launched balloon-like objects into Polish airspace four times in five days (since January 27).[[30]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06630>) ISW continues to assess that Russia has de facto annexed Belarus and that Russia is likely using airspace incursions into NATO states like Lithuania and Poland from Belarus as part of its “Phase Zero” effort — the informational and psychological condition-setting phase — to prepare for a possible NATO-Russia war in the future.[[31]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06631>)

**_Russian Supporting Effort – Northern Axis_****(Russian objective: Create defensible buffer zones in Sumy Oblast along the international border)**
**Russian forces continued offensive operations in northern Sumy Oblast on February 2 but did not make confirmed advances.**
Unconfirmed claims: Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces advanced in Pokrovka and northeast of Lukashivka (both southeast of Sumy City near the international border).[[32]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06632>) ISW continues to assess that Russian cross-border attacks in previously dormant frontline areas in northern Ukraine are part of a cognitive warfare campaign that aims to convince the West that the frontlines in Ukraine are collapsing.[[33]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06633>)
Russian forces attacked in Sumy and Kursk oblasts, including north of Sumy City near Andriivka, Oleksiivka, and Yablunivka; and northeast of Sumy City near Yunakivka on February 2.[[34]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06634>)
A Russian milblogger reportedly affiliated with the Russian Northern Grouping of Forces claimed on February 1 that over 200 personnel of the Russian 22nd Motorized Rifle Regiment (72nd Motorized Rifle Division, 44th Army Corps [AC], Leningrad Military District [LMD]) have died in the past three weeks (since roughly January 12) during Russian attempts to seize Ryzhivka (northeast of Sumy City near the international border).[[35]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06635>) The milblogger claimed that elements of the 22nd Motorized Rifle Regiment complained that the Russian military command ordered soldiers to leave wounded on the battlefield.[[36]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06636>)
Order of Battle: Drone operators of the Russian Rubikon Center for Advanced Unmanned Technologies are reportedly striking Ukrainian forces in Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts.[[37]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06637>)
** _Russian Subordinate Main Effort #1 – Kharkiv Oblast_****_(_ Russian objective: Push Ukrainian forces back from the international border to create a defensible buffer zone with Belgorod Oblast and approach to within tube artillery range of Kharkiv City)**
**Russian forces recently marginally advanced in northern Kharkiv Oblast.**
Assessed Russian advances: Geolocated footage published on February 1 indicates that Russian forces recently marginally advanced in southern Vovchansk (northeast of Kharkiv City).[[38]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06638>)
Russian forces attacked northeast of Kharkiv City near Vovchansk, Prylipka, Starytsya, Hrafske, Vovchanski Khutory, Symynivka, Vilcha, and Lyman on February 1 and 2.[[39]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06639>)
A Russian milblogger reportedly affiliated with the Russian Northern Grouping of Forces claimed on February 2 that the Russian military command replaced the commander of the Russian 128th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (44th Army Corps [AC], Leningrad Military District [LMD]), Aleksandr Mikhaylov, after 98 days in command of the brigade.[[40]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06640>) The milblogger speculated that, despite Mikhaylov’s poor performance as brigade commander, the Russian military command may promote Mikhaylov to corps command. The milblogger claimed that the Russian military command had previously appointed Mikhaylov to command the 128th Motorized Rifle Brigade in October 2025 despite the 1427th Motorized Rifle Regiment’s (11th AC, LMD) suffering heavy casualties under Mikhaylov’s command near Tetkino (southwest of Glushkovo in Kursk Oblast). The milblogger claimed that both the 1427th Motorized Rifle Regiment and 128th Motorized Rifle Brigade have lost combat effectiveness under Mikhaylov’s command and require restoration.
Order of Battle: The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) credited elements of the Russian 9th Motorized Rifle Regiment (18th Motorized Rifle Division, 11th AC) with the claimed seizure of Zelene (northeast of Kharkiv City).[[41]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06641>) Drone operators of the Chechen Akhmat Spetsnaz Vakha Battalion and the Russian 11th Tank Brigade (25th CAA, Central Military District [CMD]) are reportedly striking Ukrainian forces near Hraniv, Tsupivka, and Kozacha Lopan (all north of Kharkiv City).[[42]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06642>)
**Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Velykyi Burluk direction on February 2 but did not make confirmed advances.**
Unconfirmed claims: A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces advanced east of Kolodyazne (southeast of Velykyi Burluk).[[43]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06643>)
Russian forces attacked northeast of Velykyi Burluk near Khatnie and southeast of Velykyi Burluk near Dvorichanske on February 1 and 2.[[44]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06644>)
**_Russian Subordinate Main Effort #2 – Oskil River_****(Russian objective: Cross the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and northern Donetsk Oblast)**
**Russian forces recently advanced in the Kupyansk direction.**
Assessed Russian advances: Geolocated footage published on February 2 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced northeast of Pishchane (southeast of Kupyansk).[[45]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06645>)
Assessed Russian infiltrations: Geolocated footage published on February 1 shows Ukrainian forces striking Russian positions in central Kupyansk after what ISW assesses was a Russian infiltration mission that did not change control of terrain or the forward edge of battle area (FEBA) at this time.[[46]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06646>) ISW cannot verify the likely route that Russian forces took in central Kupyansk.
Unconfirmed claims: Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces seized Pishchane and advanced southwest of Stepova Novoselivka.[[47]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06647>)
Russian forces attacked near and within Kupyansk itself; north of Kupyansk near Kutkivka; east of Kupyansk near Petropavlivka and toward Podoly and Kucherivka; and southeast of Kupyansk near Pishchane and toward Kurylivka on February 1 and 2.[[48]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06648>)

**_Russian Subordinate Main Effort #3 – Donetsk Oblast_****(Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas, and advance into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast)**
**Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Slovyansk direction on February 2 but did not make confirmed advances.**
Unconfirmed claims: A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces seized Nykyforivka (southeast of Slovyansk).[[52]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06652>) Another milblogger claimed that Russian forces only advanced in southern Nykyforivka, however.[[53]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06653>) The milblogger claimed that Russian forces also advanced west of Bondarne (southeast of Slovyansk) and along the Lyman-Zarichne (northeast of Lyman) road.[[54]](https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/<#_edn08b21160fc98957686a28c56ef6bf06654>)
