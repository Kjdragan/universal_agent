Legal assistance on migration issues for Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad
After the start of full-scale war, Ireland became one of the countries that opened its labor market and social services to Ukrainians under temporary protection. At the same time, this status had a clear time frame from the outset. According to Relocate.to, the deadline for the temporary protection regime has already been set, and for many Ukrainians, this means they need to rethink their plans for the future.
What exactly will change after 2026, what options remain for legal residence, and why it is risky to delay a decision — we will discuss this further in this article.

The temporary protection mechanism in the EU was created as an emergency response to the crisis. In Ireland, this is particularly clear: the status is valid until a specified date and can only be extended by a political decision at the EU level. At the same time, it does not provide for an automatic transition to permanent residence or citizenship.
The Irish immigration authorities explicitly state that after this regime expires, people must either change their basis for staying or leave the country. That is why the period until 2026 has effectively become a “transition window” when there is still time to prepare an alternative path.

Ukrainians in Ireland have received IRP cards marked Stamp 4, which allow them to work without a separate work permit. However, it is important to understand that this Stamp 4 is temporary in nature and differs from the classic status of the same name.
The classic Stamp 4 is usually granted after several years of working under special permits or after obtaining long-term residency. It counts as a full period of residence for further migration purposes. Temporary Stamp 4 does not guarantee such recognition and does not create an independent migration “foundation.”

For most Ukrainians, employment in Ireland becomes the main tool for remaining in the country after the temporary protection expires. The state considers work permits as a filter for long-term immigration.
The most promising option is considered to be a permit for critically important specialists. It is focused on professions that are of strategic importance to the economy or on specialists with high incomes regardless of their field of activity. Therefore, the greater a person's contribution to the economy, the greater their chances of obtaining stable status.
There is also a general work permit, which covers a wider range of professions, from service to manufacturing. Although this path is longer and involves greater dependence on the employer, for many it remains a realistic option for continuing legal residence.

_How to obtain a work permit in Ireland_ _— read the link._
The period of temporary protection actually gives Ukrainians a unique starting position. The ability to work without additional permits allows them to gain Irish experience, integrate into the local labor market, and build trust with their employer.
In practice, it is often the employee who initiates the transition to a work permit, discussing it with the company in advance. Waiting for the status to expire is the riskiest strategy, as once it expires, the options for maneuver become much more limited.
The Irish system is structured in such a way that both the number of years in the country and the type of status play a key role. Only full legal residence with the appropriate permits counts towards long-term residence and citizenship.
The period spent under temporary protection remains a “gray area.” It may not be taken into account or may be taken into account partially. Therefore, lawyers advise not to make long-term plans based solely on TPD, but to switch to statuses that form a stable migration history as early as possible.
In addition to work, there are other ways to stay in Ireland — study, entrepreneurial programs, or family reunification. However, each of them has its limitations. Student statuses do not count as full-fledged residence, business migration requires significant financial resources, and family grounds directly depend on the main migration status.
Therefore, for most Ukrainians, these routes are more auxiliary than primary and require careful legal analysis.
Remember that changing to a different status, preparing documents, and negotiating with an employer can take months or even years. Not having a plan can lead to the loss of legal residence, even if a person has been living and working in the country for a long time.

Will temporary protection for Ukrainians in Ireland continue after 2026?
Currently, temporary protection in Ireland is valid until March 2026. Its further extension is only possible by a separate decision at the EU level. There is no provision for automatic extension, so Ukrainians are advised to prepare alternative options for legal residence in advance.
What will happen to Ukrainians in Ireland after the temporary protection ends?
After the temporary protection ends, Ukrainians must either switch to another legal migration status or leave the country. Temporary protection status alone does not give the right to remain in Ireland after it expires.
Does the period of temporary protection count towards Irish citizenship?
The question of whether the period of temporary protection counts towards citizenship remains unclear. In most cases, this period is not considered a full term of legal residence, so it is risky to rely solely on it to obtain citizenship.
