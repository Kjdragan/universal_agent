The security of Ukraine is of great importance to NATO and its member states. The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence, and its right to choose its own security arrangements. Ukraine’s future is in NATO. Relations between NATO and Ukraine date back to the early 1990s and have since developed into one of the most substantial of NATO’s partnerships. Since 2014, in the wake of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, cooperation has been intensified in critical areas. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, NATO and Allies have provided unprecedented levels of support.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv during his first official visit as Secretary General on 3 October 2024.
* Dialogue and cooperation started when newly independent Ukraine joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (1991) and the Partnership for Peace programme (1994).
* Relations were strengthened with the signing of the 1997 Charter on a Distinctive Partnership, and further enhanced in 2009 with the Declaration to Complement the Charter, which reaffirmed the decision by NATO Leaders at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of NATO.
* The 1997 Charter established the NATO-Ukraine Commission as the main body responsible for developing the NATO-Ukraine relationship and for directing cooperative activities. In 2023, the Commission was replaced by the NATO-Ukraine Council, where Allies and Ukraine sit as equals. This change demonstrates the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine’s increasing integration with NATO.
* Cooperation has deepened over time and is mutually beneficial. Ukraine has a long track record of active contributions to NATO-led operations and missions.
* NATO condemns Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. This aggression gravely undermines Euro-Atlantic and global security, and is a blatant violation of international law. NATO Allies, in concert with relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly, demand that Russia stop the war immediately, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its forces from Ukraine.
* The Allies do not and will never recognise Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexations, including of Crimea. Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of its aggression in eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO has reinforced its support for capability development and capacity-building in Ukraine, alongside Allied training of tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops.
* Since the 2016 Warsaw Summit, NATO's practical support is set out in the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) for Ukraine. At the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allies strengthened the CAP to provide even more support to Ukraine. At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies agreed to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme of assistance, to help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and transition Ukraine towards full interoperability with NATO.
* At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies agreed to establish NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by Allies and partners. They also announced a Pledge of Long-Term Security Assistance for Ukraine, providing a minimum baseline funding of EUR 40 billion within the next year, and sustainable levels of security assistance in the future. In 2024, Allies provided EUR 50 billion to Ukraine, with nearly 60% coming from European Allies and Canada. In 2025, Allies have so far committed an additional EUR 35 billion in security assistance, and this support is expected to continue.
* NATO stands in unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land and our shared values. The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
* In response to Ukraine’s aspirations for NATO membership, Allies agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of NATO. They also agreed that Ukraine’s next step on its way to membership was the Membership Action Plan (MAP), NATO’s programme of political, economic, defence, resource, security and legal reforms for aspirant countries. In 2009, the Annual National Programme was introduced as Ukraine’s key instrument to advance its Euro-Atlantic integration and related reforms.
* From 2010 to 2014, Ukraine pursued a non-alignment policy, which it terminated in response to Russia’s aggression. In June 2017, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted legislation reinstating membership in NATO as a strategic foreign and security policy objective. In 2019, a corresponding amendment to Ukraine's Constitution entered into force.
* In September 2020, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy approved Ukraine's new National Security Strategy, which provides for the development of the distinctive partnership with NATO with the aim of membership in NATO. In September 2022, following Russia’s illegal attempted annexations of Ukrainian territory, Ukraine reiterated its request for NATO membership.
* Recognising Ukraine’s increased interoperability and substantial progress with reforms, Allies decided at the 2023 Vilnius Summit that Ukraine’s path to full Euro-Atlantic integration has moved beyond the need for the Membership Action Plan – changing Ukraine’s path to NATO from a two-step process to a one-step process.
* Allies have reaffirmed that Ukraine’s future is in NATO and that they will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership. To that end, Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s progress on interoperability, as well as additional democratic and security sector reforms, which NATO Foreign Ministers will continue to assess through the adapted Annual National Programme. Allied Leaders have reaffirmed that they will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.
NATO condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia's illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, which gravely undermines Euro-Atlantic and global security and stability, and is a blatant violation of international law. NATO Allies, in concert with relevant resolutions of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, demand that Russia stop the war immediately, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its forces from Ukraine.
Furthermore, NATO Allies call on Russia to fully respect international humanitarian law, and to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access and assistance to all persons in need. There can be no impunity for Russian war crimes and other atrocities, such as attacks against civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, which deprives millions of Ukrainians of basic human services. All those responsible must be held accountable for violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, particularly against Ukraine’s civilian population, including the forced deportation of children and conflict-related sexual violence.
Russia’s war has also had a profound impact on the environment, nuclear safety, energy and food security, the global economy, and the welfare of billions of people around the world. Allies and Ukraine strongly condemn Russia’s decision to withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal and its deliberate attempts to stop Ukraine’s agricultural exports, on which hundreds of millions of people worldwide depend. Allies are working to support the continued exports of Ukrainian grain by land and sea, including in cooperation with the European Union and the United Nations.
Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of its aggression in eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO has adopted a firm position in full support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, extending to its territorial waters. The Allies strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation.
NATO Allies have equally condemned Russia's continued aggression and destabilising activities in eastern Ukraine and the Black Sea region since 2014. NATO has increased its presence in the Black Sea and stepped up maritime cooperation with Ukraine and Georgia.
NATO also condemns Russia's illegal attempt to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – in September 2022, which is the largest attempted land grab in Europe since the Second World War. The sham referenda in these regions were engineered in Moscow and imposed on Ukraine. They have no legitimacy, and NATO will not recognise them. These lands are Ukraine and will always be Ukraine. The overwhelming vote in the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia's attempted annexations sent a clear and strong message that Russia is isolated and that the world stands with Ukraine, in defence of the rules-based international order.
As a result of Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, NATO Allies decided in 2014 to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia, while leaving political and military channels of communication open. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Allies have imposed severe sanctions on Russia to weaken its economy and deprive the country of critical technologies and markets, decreasing its ability to rebuild its military at a faster pace. Allies continue to refine these sanctions in order to increase the pressure on Moscow. Sanctions make it harder for Russia to repair its armoured vehicles and aircraft, manufacture missiles, and finance its war.
Since 2014, regular consultations have taken place in the NATO-Ukraine Commission in view of the direct threats faced by Ukraine to its territorial integrity, political independence and security. The Commission met for extraordinary meetings following Russia’s aggression in Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, after Russia's unjustified use of military force against Ukrainian ships near the Kerch Strait in November 2018 and during Russia's threatening military build-up in April 2021. Other extraordinary meetings of the Commission took place at NATO Headquarters in January and February 2022, focused on Russia's military build-up and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Throughout the war, NATO and Ukraine continued to consult on the security situation and Allied support to Ukraine through the Commission. In July 2023, at the Vilnius Summit, the Commission was upgraded into the NATO-Ukraine Council, demonstrating the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine’s increasing integration with NATO.
NATO stands in unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land and our shared values. The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. NATO Allies remain steadfast in their commitment to further stepping up political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.
In parallel to its political support, NATO has significantly stepped up its practical assistance to Ukraine. Immediately following the illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, NATO Foreign Ministers agreed on measures to enhance Ukraine's ability to provide for its own security. They also decided to further develop their practical support to Ukraine, based on a significant enhancement of existing cooperation programmes as well as the development of substantial new programmes.
At the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, the Alliance's measures in support of Ukraine became part of the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP), which is designed to support Ukraine's ability to provide for its own security and to implement wide-ranging reforms based on NATO standards, Euro-Atlantic principles and best practices.
Under the CAP, NATO has helped Ukraine transform its security and defence sector for many years, providing strategic-level advice via the NATO Representation to Ukraine as well as NATO Headquarters, and practical support through a range of capacity-building programmes and initiatives. Through these programmes and tailored advice, NATO has significantly strengthened the capacity and resilience of Ukraine's security and defence sector, as well as its ability to counter hybrid threats. NATO and Allies have also provided extensive support to capability development, including through training and education and the provision of equipment.
At the 2022 NATO Summit in Madrid, Allies agreed to strengthen the CAP and provide even more support to Ukraine. The strengthened CAP includes initiatives to provide Ukraine with immediate, short-term, non-lethal military assistance, as well as structures to boost NATO's long-term support. At the 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius, Allies agreed to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme of assistance for Ukraine, based on sustained and predictable funding. Longer-term support is organised through three principal lines of effort: recovery and reconstruction, institutional transformation, and transition towards NATO interoperability.

The NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis, Training and Education Centre (JATEC) in Bydgoszcz, Poland is the first joint NATO-Ukraine organisation and an important pillar of NATO-Ukraine relations. At the Centre, Ukrainian and NATO personnel work hand-in-hand to identify and apply lessons learned from Russia’s war against Ukraine, and embed these lessons into NATO and Ukrainian strategies, policies and operations. This helps strengthen Ukraine’s armed forces and build interoperability with NATO.
The JATEC is part of the NATO Command Structure, reporting directly to Allied Command Transformation. Since opening, the Centre has carried out projects focused on air defence, protection of critical infrastructure and resilience.
In February 2024, Defence Ministers from NATO and Ukraine agreed to create the JATEC. At the Washington Summit in July 2024, NATO Leaders further endorsed its establishment as a civil-military centre with NATO Military Headquarters status. The JATEC officially opened in February 2025.
NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) is a NATO command that coordinates the provision of military equipment and training to Ukraine by NATO member and partner countries. This includes:
* coordinating the training of Ukrainian forces provided by NATO Allies at facilities in Allied countries;
* coordinating the supply from donors of tens of billions of euros worth of military donations, such as Stinger surface-to-air missiles and Leopard 2 tanks;
* managing the repair and maintenance of equipment and its transfer to logistical hubs in the eastern part of the Alliance (NATO is not involved in the onward delivery of aid into Ukraine itself); and
* supporting the long-term development of Ukraine’s armed forces, enabling Ukraine’s further integration and increased interoperability with NATO.
NSATU places security assistance to Ukraine on an enduring footing, ensuring enhanced, predictable and coherent support for the long term. It brings together much of the security support being provided by the international community to Ukraine under one overarching framework, improving coordination, accountability and burden-sharing among Allies. NSATU, which operates only on Allied territory, helps Ukraine uphold its right to self-defence, as enshrined in the UN Charter; it does not, under international law, make NATO a party to the conflict.
NSATU is based in Wiesbaden, Germany with three logistical hubs in the eastern part of the Alliance. It is led by a three-star general reporting to NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and involves around 700 personnel from NATO member and partner countries, including Ukraine.
NSATU was agreed by NATO Leaders at the Washington Summit in July 2024. As of December 2024, NSATU is up and running. In early January 2025, NATO took over command and control from the United States of air defences in Poland that safeguard NSATU’s logistical enabling hubs.
Since the start of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, Allies have provided unprecedented political, economic, military, financial and humanitarian support, including military assistance amounting to roughly EUR 40 billion annually. Allies have also made their defence industrial capacity available to support Ukraine’s needs. All of this is having a substantial effect, enabling Ukraine to defend effectively and inflict real and severe costs on Russia.
At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allied Leaders announced a Pledge of Long-Term Security Assistance for Ukraine. Through proportional contributions, Allies agreed to provide a minimum baseline funding of EUR 40 billion within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail. Allies far exceeded this number in 2024, providing over EUR 50 billion, nearly 60% of which came from European Allies and Canada. In 2025, Allies have so far committed an additional EUR 35 billion in security assistance, and this support is expected to continue.
Allies report to NATO on support delivered in relation to this Pledge twice per year. Based on this, the Secretary General provides an overview of all notified contributions to Allies. Heads of State and Government will re-evaluate Allied contributions at future NATO summits.
In addition to providing security assistance directly to Ukraine, Allies also fund support to Ukraine through NATO. The Alliance’s practical support to Ukraine is organised through two main funding channels: the Ukraine CAP Trust Fund and the NATO civil budget.
As part of the CAP, several Trust Funds have been launched since 2014, providing resources to support capability development and sustainable capacity-building in key areas. In 2021, NATO consolidated and transitioned all pre-existing Trust Funds supporting Ukraine into a single Ukraine CAP Trust Fund. The Ukraine CAP Trust Fund enables resourcing for Ukraine-related activities within a single dedicated instrument – a flexible and scalable fund to provide Ukraine with short-term non-lethal military assistance (sustainment) as well as long-term capacity-building support. As of June 2025, Allies and partners have contributed over EUR 1 billion (approximately USD 1.1 billion) to the Ukraine CAP Trust Fund.
The NSATU Trust Fund, managed by the United Kingdom, enables NSATU to quickly respond to Ukraine’s urgent wartime requirements. To that end, it helps provide rapid procurement and delivery of urgent goods and services for the Ukrainian military. It will also help put recurrent military assistance on a sustainable, campaign footing.
_**Increase of the NATO civil budget to support Ukraine**_
At the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allied Leaders agreed as part of the NATO 2030 agenda to boost training and capacity-building, including to partners, and to increase the NATO common funding ceilings year-on-year in real terms. These increases started in 2023 and provide a predictable source of Allied funding to achieve results in these vital areas.
From January 2023 through the 2025 fiscal year, almost EUR 35 million has been dedicated to cooperative security initiatives to further support selected partner countries, including Ukraine. Under the CAP, this key funding source enables projects to be developed and implemented in areas such as defence planning and interoperability, governance and integrity, immediate non-lethal practical support, information technology, and education and training.
NATO welcomes the bilateral, long-term security commitments that Allies and NATO partners have agreed with Ukraine based on the G7 Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine launched at the 2023 Vilnius Summit.
These agreements are mutually reinforcing and are a testament to the shared and unwavering commitment to a free, independent, democratic and sovereign Ukraine, within its internationally recognised borders, capable of defending itself and deterring future aggression. These commitments, together with the decisions taken at the 2024 Washington Summit, provide for sustained, enduring support to Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and support Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration.
The NATO Representation to Ukraine (NRU) facilitates political and military dialogue and cooperation between the Alliance and Ukraine, and coordinates NATO’s practical support to Ukraine.
A key role of the NRU is to provide advisory assistance to Ukraine’s security and defence sector, helping Ukraine transition its armed forces towards full interoperability with NATO and implement its adapted Annual National Programme. The NRU is also a principal stakeholder in coordinating the Comprehensive Assistance Package, the overarching framework through which NATO provides practical support to Ukraine, and it leads NATO’s public communications in Ukraine.
* maintaining contact with Ukrainian ministries and agencies, enhancing NATO-Ukraine political and military dialogue;
* advising Ukrainian authorities on activities in support of the NATO-Ukraine partnership and reforms, in particular the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Interior, the National Security and Defence Council, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Parliament, and non-governmental organisations;
* increasing awareness and understanding of NATO in Ukraine;
* informing the Ukrainian public about key activities in NATO-Ukraine cooperation; and
* providing advice and support to Ukrainian institutions in the area of strategic communications capability development.
As NATO and Ukraine continue to intensify their cooperation and strengthen Ukraine’s political integration with NATO, the Alliance has reinforced the NRU and expanded its staff levels at the office in Kyiv. To that end, in July 2024, the Secretary General appointed a NATO Senior Representative to head the NRU and to act as a focal point for NATO’s engagement with Ukrainian authorities in Kyiv.
The NRU was established in September 2015 by merging two already existing offices: the NATO Information and Documentation Centre (NIDC) and the NATO Liaison Office (NLO). The NIDC was inaugurated in Kyiv in May 1997 to support efforts to inform the Ukrainian public about NATO's activities and the benefits of NATO-Ukraine cooperation.
Part of the NATO Office of Information and Press (now the Public Diplomacy Division), it was the first information office established by NATO in a partner country and open to the general public. The NLO was established in Kyiv in April 1999 to facilitate Ukraine's participation in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme and to support Ukrainian efforts in the area of defence reform.
NATO-Ukraine relations were formally launched in 1991, when the newly independent country joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), a forum for dialogue and cooperation between NATO Allies and their former Warsaw Pact adversaries. A few years later, in 1994, Ukraine joined the Partnership for Peace (PfP), a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual partner countries and NATO. It was one of the founding members of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), which replaced the NACC in May 1997.
The July 1997 Charter on a Distinctive Partnership remains the basic foundation underpinning NATO-Ukraine relations. The Charter established the  _NATO-Ukraine Commission_ as the main body responsible for advancing NATO-Ukraine relations. The Commission directed cooperative activities and provided a forum for consultation between the Allies and Ukraine on security issues of common concern.
The Declaration to Complement the Charter, signed in 2009 as a follow-up to the decisions taken at the 2008 NATO Summit in Bucharest, gave the Commission a central role in deepening political dialogue and cooperation to underpin Ukraine's reform efforts pertaining to its Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO. The principal tool to support this process is the Annual National Programme (ANP), which reflects Ukraine's national reform objectives and annual implementation plans. The ANP has been composed of five chapters focusing on: political and economic issues; defence and military issues; resources; security issues; and legal issues. This includes reforms related to good governance, the fight against corruption, the rule of law, human rights, and the security and defence sector, in accordance with Euro-Atlantic principles and standards.
Allies assess progress under the ANP annually. The responsibility for its implementation falls primarily on Ukraine. The Commission for Coordination of Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, ensures the general coordination of its implementation by the state bodies.
In 2023, the NATO-Ukraine Council was established as the successor to the NATO-Ukraine Commission. The change from Commission to Council demonstrates the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine’s increasing integration with NATO. In the Council format, Ukraine sits alongside all NATO member states as an equal participant. The Council can be convened by the Secretary General as well as by its individual participants, including Ukraine, for crisis consultations. The inaugural meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council took place on 12 July 2023 at the Vilnius Summit.
Since 2014, in the wake of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, NATO-Ukraine cooperation has been intensified in critical areas. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine starting in February 2022, NATO and Allies have provided unprecedented levels of support to Ukraine.
But NATO's support to Ukraine and activities in partnership with the country did not begin in 2014 or 2022 – practical cooperation between NATO and Ukraine has been ongoing since the 1990s. Over the years, Ukraine's cooperation with NATO has been mutually beneficial and has covered a wide range of activities – from building Ukraine's capabilities and interoperability with NATO forces, to promoting reforms in Ukraine's defence and related security sector, to supporting non-military activities like collaborative scientific research and public diplomacy.
NATO's cooperation with Ukraine has been implemented through the following programmes and initiatives:
At the 2024 Washington Summit, NATO and Ukrainian Leaders endorsed the NATO-Ukraine Innovation Cooperation Roadmap. This agreement has five key objectives:
* helping meet Ukraine’s urgent needs through innovative solutions;
* strengthening Ukraine’s innovation system and making it more resilient;
* enhancing cooperation between NATO’s and Ukraine’s innovation networks;
* sharing best practice on Ukrainian technologies and tactics; and
* bolstering NATO’s military innovation and technological change.
The roadmap establishes NATO as a central platform through which Ukraine can communicate its needs for new technologies, encourage innovation and invite the public and private sector to match those needs. It also encourages stronger ties between NATO’s and Ukraine's innovation initiatives, including through prize challenges, hackathons and other collaborative activities. For example, in June 2024, NATO and Ukraine launched their first joint Defence Innovators Forum, which brought together more than 450 technology start-ups, investors, researchers and government officials. These and similar efforts will help unlock Ukraine's innovation potential and ensure both NATO and Ukraine can find innovative solutions to real-world operational challenges.
Against the background of the initial stages of Russia's war against Ukraine – not just the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, but also the use of cyber attacks, disinformation and other hybrid activities over the subsequent years – the NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfarewas established at the NATO Summit in Warsaw in July 2016. It provides a mechanism to be better able to identify hybrid threats and to build capacity in identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening resilience of the state and society. Projects in support of research, training and expert consultations are ongoing, with a focus on lessons learned, countering disinformation and enhancing resilience.
Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of eastern Ukraine in 2014, experts have provided advice on Ukraine's contingency plans and crisis management measures to defend critical energy infrastructure and protect the civilian population. Today, cooperation focuses on improving national capacity for civil preparedness and resilience. In 2019, a Resilience Advisory Support Team (RAST) drew up recommendations to Ukrainian institutions with regard to the enhancement of national resilience. At Ukraine's request, follow-up expert-level RAST consultations providing technical advice to support the country's long-term resilience and civil preparedness activities took place in early 2022, prior to Russia's full-scale invasion. Ukraine also participates regularly in activities organised by NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre and has itself hosted multiple disaster response exercises.
Participation in the Planning and Review Process has helped Ukraine set and achieve ambitious yet realistic objectives for defence and security reforms, transformation and capability development; for improving the ability of its forces to operate alongside Allied and partner forces in crisis response and peace-support operations; and for enhancing Ukraine's ability to host Allied and partner forces for exercises and training.
Since 2007, Ukraine has participated in NATO'sBuilding Integrity(BI)Initiative, which provides practical assistance and advice for strengthening integrity, accountability and transparency in the defence and security sector. In October 2019, nine institutions of Ukraine's defence and security sector completed the NATO BI Self-Assessment and Peer Review Process, which provided a thorough assessment of institutional needs and vulnerabilities and offered a set of policy-level sectoral recommendations to improve good governance and pursue sustainable anti-corruption reforms in the defence and related security sectors. On this basis, a tailored programme of activities continues to provide two levels of capacity-building support – specific expertise to the institutions to enhance the good governance and management of defence resources (financial, human and materiel), and education and training activities to develop individual capacities and foster an organisational culture of integrity.
Since 2013, the Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP) has helped to improve and restructure Ukraine's military education and professional training systems, focusing on eight defence higher education institutions and five training centres for Non-Commissioned Officers. Additionally, DEEP advises on management of the academies and universities, supporting faculty on how to teach and assisting in the development of courses on leadership and decision-making processes. The focus of the DEEP programme for officers is on: curriculum and faculty development; instructor training; English language training; occupational specialties development; lessons learned system development; e-learning systems; and increasing institutional capacities. The focus of the DEEP programme for NCOs is on instructor training, firearms instructor training and combat squad leader training.
Ukraine joined the Air Situation Data Exchange programme in July 2006. It enhances awareness and aviation safety through the mutual sharing of air situation data, which improves the operational effectiveness of air defence through the identification, classification and potential de-confliction of aircraft. This capability has had particular operational relevance and benefit following Russia's further invasion of Ukrainian territory since February 2022. NATO has been working closely with Ukraine to provide the most relevant information possible.
Participation in a wide range of military activities and exercises under the Military Committee with Ukraine Work Planfocuses on improving the interoperability and operational capabilities of Ukraine's armed forces, but also substantially contributes to ongoing security and defence reforms.
Ukraine's active participation in the NATO Operational Capabilities Concept Evaluation and Feedback Programme supports the further development of the armed forces, while also enabling the Alliance to put together tailored force packages that can be deployed in support of NATO-led operations and missions.
Ukraine has been actively engaged in NATO's Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme since 1991. A Working Group on Scientific and Environmental Cooperation contributes to identifying priority areas for practical scientific cooperation in the framework of the SPS Programme. Since 2014, in response to the crisis in Ukraine, cooperation in the field of security-related civil science and technology has been strengthened, and Ukraine has since become the largest beneficiary of the SPS Programme. Leading areas of cooperation with Ukraine in the SPS framework include advanced technology, counter-terrorism, defence against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents, as well as energy and environmental security. Among these activities, noteworthy is the participation of Ukraine in the DEXTER Programme, which is developing an integrated system to detect explosives and firearms in public spaces.
In addition to the programmes listed above, Ukraine has participated in many other initiatives organised through the advisory mission of the NATO Representation in Ukraine.
* NATO supports Ukraine in implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.
* A legal framework has been established to enable NATO and Ukraine to further develop operational cooperation, including the Partnership for Peace (PfP) Status of Forces Agreement (entered into force in May 2000); the Host Nation Support Agreement (ratified in March 2004); and the Strategic Airlift Agreement (ratified in October 2006).
* In June 2020, Ukraine became an Enhanced Opportunity Partner (EOP). This is a status offered to participants in NATO's Partnership Interoperability Initiative that have made particularly significant contributions to NATO operations and other Alliance objectives. EOP status works as a facilitator, providing Ukraine preferential access to NATO's interoperability toolbox, including exercises, training, exchange of information and situational awareness. The other EOPs are Australia, Georgia and Jordan.
* Ukraine also built capacity and interoperability through participation in the NATO Response Force.
Ukraine has contributed to the peace-support operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has also contributed to the Kosovo Force (KFOR), including with a heavy engineering unit with counter-improvised explosive devices capabilities.
In support of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, Ukraine allowed over-flight clearance and the transit of supplies, and contributed medical personnel to support Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan and instructors to the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan. Following the end of ISAF's mission in 2014, Ukraine supported the follow-on Resolute Support Mission (2015-2021) to train, advise and assist Afghan security forces.
From March 2005, Ukraine contributed officers to the NATO Training Mission in Iraq, which terminated in December 2011.
Ukraine deployed ships six times between 2007 and 2010 in support of Operation Active Endeavour, a counter-terrorist maritime surveillance operation in the Mediterranean Sea. In 2013, it also contributed to NATO's counter-piracy operation Ocean Shield. Since the launch of maritime operation Sea Guardian in 2016, Ukraine has provided information in support of NATO's maritime situational awareness in and around the Black Sea.
