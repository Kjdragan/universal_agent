_On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a "special military operation" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the "Donbass republics" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace._
_"To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole." [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]_
**The UK Ministry of Defence** reported that on 28 and 29 January 2025, Russian merchant vessels SPARTA II and SPARTA reportedly departed Tartus, Russia's strategically important naval base in Syria. The two merchant vessels are highly likely returning evacuated equipment and personnel to alternative basing locations away from the Mediterranean Sea, accompanied by four Russian Federation Navy vessels.
Negotiations between Russian Government representatives and Syria's ruling administration, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), regarding the future of Russian bases, are almost certainly ongoing. Russia is almost certainly continuing to actively engage HTS to develop ties and promote itself as a beneficial partner. However, Russia is in a weaker negotiating position due to various factors, likely including the Syrian leadership's hostility towards the former Syrian dictator, Bashar Al-Assad, currently harboured by Russia.
Whilst the Ukraine conflict remains Russia's primary concern, maintaining a presence in the eastern Mediterranean almost certainly remains a strategic priority for Russia, allowing it to project military power in the region and support its operations in Africa. Russia's preoccupation with the Ukraine conflict likely reduced its situational awareness in Syria affecting its ability to keep the Assad regime in power, thereby undermining Russia's strategic interests in the Middle East, Mediterranean and Africa.
**The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine** reported that in total, there have been 127 combat clashes since the beginning of this day.
