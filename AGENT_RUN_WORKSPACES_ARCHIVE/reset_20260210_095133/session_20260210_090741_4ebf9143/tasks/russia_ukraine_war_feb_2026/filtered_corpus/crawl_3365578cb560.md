| **Urgent support for Ukraine's defence -** the European Parliament will vote next Wednesday on a €90 billion support loan package for Ukraine.In December, the European Council agreed to provide €90 billion for Ukraine's budgetary and military needs over 2026-2027. This loan comprises €60 billion for military assistance and €30 billion for budget support, financed through EU borrowing with potential repayment from immobilised Russian assets. Since the war began, the EU has provided €193.3 billion in total support to Ukraine.Swift adoption is essential so the Commission can begin disbursing funds - Ukraine cannot wait. This urgent support must strengthen Ukraine's defence capabilities and ensure continued state functioning while integrating Ukraine into Europe's defence industrial base._Vote : Wednesday 11 February, 12:00_**Building European defence sovereignty.** The EU faces its gravest security challenge since WWII. Russia's aggression in Ukraine, hybrid threats, cyberattacks, and shifting US-China priorities demand urgent action. Europe can no longer rely solely on traditional arrangements - it must build sovereign military capabilities and defence industrial capacity through the European Defence Industrial Programme and Strategic Defence Partnerships.Renew Europe's demands :First, rapidly implement EDIP with concrete financial support for production facilities and innovation, fully integrating Ukraine into Europe's defence industrial base. Second, accelerate Strategic Defence Partnerships with like-minded countries, prioritizing joint training and interoperability. Third, create a genuine single defence market, protect critical infrastructure, and ensure supply chain resilience through coordinated monitoring and crisis response mechanisms._Debate : "Building a stronger European defence in light of an increasingly volatile international environment", Tuesday 10 February, 9:00_ _Vote on the report "EU strategic defence and security partnerships, Wednesday 11 February, 12:00_**Renew MEPs : Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann (FDP, Germany), chair of the SEDE committee & Nathalie Loiseau (Horizons, France), Renew coordinator for the SEDE committee. ****Regaining Europe’s competitive edge -** Antonio Costa invited European leaders to an informal meeting to discuss Europe’s economic problems on February 12th. Ahead of that meeting Renew Europe will send a letter asking him to not walk away from that gathering without tangible results on the Savings and Investment Union, Energy and technological sovereignty.Mario Draghi will be invited at the gathering too. Renew Europe, in collaboration with the European Policy Innovation Council (EPIC), will release new implementation figures for the Draghi report._Debate "Urgent actions to revive EU competitiveness, deepen the EU Single Market : from the Draghi report to reality" : Wednesday 11 February, 9:00_**Rule of law under threat in the US -** Recent deaths of two peaceful protesters in the US, escalating securitization, militarized ICE operations, and militia-like violence signal alarming threats to the rule of law and democracy.Renew Europe expresses grave concern over ICE abuses threatening democratic principles. We reaffirm that the rule of law protects against arbitrary power - the US justice must operate independently and protesters' rights must be safeguarded. We demand a profound assessment of EU-US cooperation implications and urge the Commission to halt negotiations on data-sharing agreements that would grant US authorities access to European biometric records until these rule of law concerns are addressed._Debate : "State violence in Minneapolis and the rule of law in the United States", Wednesday 11 February, 13:00_
