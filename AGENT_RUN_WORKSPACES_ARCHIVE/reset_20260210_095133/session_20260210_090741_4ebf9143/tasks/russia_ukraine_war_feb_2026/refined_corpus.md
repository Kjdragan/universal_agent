### Friday briefing: Why a growing number of experts say Israel is practising apartheid
**Source:** theguardian.com, [Date: unknown (Future date context: Oct 2025 mentioned in text)]

*   The Rafah crossing has reopened partially, but movement remains tightly controlled by Israel, which determines who is permitted to leave or return. Of roughly 4,000 patients with official medical referrals, only a small fraction have been allowed to leave, and fewer still have been allowed back.
*   Since a ceasefire was signed in the previous October, more than 556 Palestinians have been killed, and airstrikes continue.
*   In the West Bank, mass displacement is accelerating, with the UN and Israeli soldiers warning that the army is entangled with settler violence, with reserve units from settlements accused of operating as vigilante militias.
*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel’s “security control” from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean would remain indefinitely. The occupation is in its 58th year.
*   Journalist Nathan Thrall argues that there is one sovereign state (Israel) controlling the entire area, and it is practising apartheid. He defines this as a system where one racial group (Jewish Israelis) maintains dominance over another (Palestinians) through systematic oppression.
*   Thrall notes that between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, there are roughly 7.5 million Jewish Israelis with full rights and 7.5 million Palestinians subjected to varying degrees of discrimination.
*   The apartheid label is increasingly accepted by international human rights groups (B’Tselem, HRW in 2021; Amnesty in 2022) and legal bodies.
*   In July 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion declaring Israel’s occupation unlawful and finding that its activities amounted to apartheid.
*   A growing number of former Israeli officials dispute the government's rejection of the apartheid label, including former Mossad head Tamir Pardo, former parliament speaker Avraham Burg, and historian Benny Morris.
*   Benjamin Pogrund, a South African anti-apartheid activist who previously defended Israel, shifted his view in 2023, citing the actions of Netanyahu’s government.
*   Thrall describes a segregated legal system where an Israeli Jew and a Palestinian committing the same crime at the same location would face different courts: the Jew in a civilian court, the Palestinian in a military court with a 99% conviction rate.
*   Physical infrastructure is segregated, with a two-tier road system. Settlers use multi-lane highways, while Palestinians are restricted to indirect, congested "fabric of life" roads, often passing under settler highways.
*   Thrall states that settlement expansion, displacement, and home demolitions are accelerating at the "fastest pace that’s ever happened before," with entire communities disappearing.
*   Arguing that internal change is unlikely due to the "total normalcy" felt by Israeli voters, Thrall suggests outside pressure is necessary, specifically suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement and halting arms sales.

### Russia yet to receive satisfactory proposals to start talks on Ukraine, RIA reports
**Source:** reuters.com, [Date: 2026-02-10]

*   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin stated that Moscow has not yet received "concrete proposals" or a "good offer" to start talks on ending the war in Ukraine.
*   Galuzin emphasized that words must be backed by practical steps that account for Russia’s "legitimate interests," address root causes, and recognize "new realities."
*   This statement follows conflicting messages regarding potential negotiations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
*   Trump stated he has spoken with Putin, expects more conversations, and believes they are "making progress" to stop the war.
*   The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov would neither confirm nor deny the communications regarding a potential Trump-Putin meeting, stating "many different communications are emerging."
*   Trump indicated he would probably meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the coming week.
*   The war marks its third anniversary on February 24.
*   Galuzin reiterated Moscow's unchanged demands: no further NATO expansion and the protection of the rights of Russian residents in Ukraine.

### Plenary priorities 9-12 February 2026 - Renew Europe
**Source:** reneweuropegroup.eu, [Date: 2026-02-09]
