Ukraine war 4-year mark: Civilian deaths, injuries rise as funding falls to record low
As Ukrainians face a fifth year of full-scale war, CARE is warning of the long-lasting and dangerous impact of living just to survive while lifelines are cut.
In response, Michael McGrath, CARE Ukraine’s Country Director, said:
“After four years of full‑scale war, people describe to us endless nights spent half‑awake, listening for drones or blocking out the sound of explosions, unable to recall what true rest feels like… Their strength has carried them this far, but the toll of constant fear and trauma is becoming impossible to ignore. We witness this in the consequences of psychological distress and many cases of gender-based violence, which are often underreported.”

refugees have fled Ukraine for Poland, the largest number registered in any European country.
For 10 years, Olena moved within Ukraine to escape conflict. The 2022 invasion led her to finally cross into Poland.
Starting fresh in Poland with CARE's support
Olena, a trained healthcare specialist, found her Ukrainian diploma was not recognized in Poland. Determined to continue her profession, she enrolled in a Polish medical university to pursue a full bachelor’s degree – a journey will take several years.
CARE covered her first year of study and offered language classes, financial help, and advice.
After fleeing war in Ukraine, Olena is now a refugee in Poland, where she works as a nurse.
"CARE's support has been life-changing. It helps you feel that you matter."
CARE Poland is currently the only organization providing cash assistance to new refugees entering Poland, making stories like Olena’s possible. Similar programs run by other NGOs have been closed, mostly due to lack of funding.
Other types of aid that CARE Poland provides include:
