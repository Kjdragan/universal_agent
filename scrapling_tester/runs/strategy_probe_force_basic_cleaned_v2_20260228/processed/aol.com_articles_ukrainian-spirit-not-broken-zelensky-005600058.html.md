Ukrainian spirit 'not broken' as Zelensky marks 4 years of war with Russia
Wed, February 25, 2026 at 1:14 AM UTC

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia has not broken Ukrainians' spirits nor triumphed in its war, four years after the invasion.
The Ukrainian leader hosted more than a dozen senior European officials in Kyiv to mark the grim,
four-year anniversary of the conflict.
Zelenskyy said his country has withstood the onslaught by Russia's bigger and better-equipped army, which over the past year of fighting captured just 0.79% of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank.

"Looking back at the beginning of the invasion and reflecting on today, we have every right to say: We have defended our independence, we have not lost our statehood," Zelenskyy said on social media, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin has "not achieved his goals."
"He has not broken Ukrainians; he has not won this war," Zelenskyy added.

Ukraine has struggled to hold off Russia's invasion, which has managed to secure around 20% of its territory.
Additionally, the war has brought widespread hardship for Ukrainians, many of whom have been displaced due to Russia's aerial attacks, which have destroyed homes and denied civilians power and running water.
Russian President Vladimir Putin did not acknowledge the four-year anniversary of the invasion. He spoke at a meeting in Moscow of top officials of the Federal Security Service on Tuesday.

Putin told the FSS officials that the threat of Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil has grown. Ukraine has increasingly deployed long-range drones that it has developed to strike oil refineries, fuel depots and military logistics hubs inside Russia.
As the war enters its fifth year, the UN has called for an immediate ceasefire during the General Assembly, which passed a resolution reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The UN chief told the Security Council diplomats must use every tool available to finally end the war.
For months, the U.S. has been engaged in diplomatic talks to end the conflict, though it seems no closer to a peace deal.
