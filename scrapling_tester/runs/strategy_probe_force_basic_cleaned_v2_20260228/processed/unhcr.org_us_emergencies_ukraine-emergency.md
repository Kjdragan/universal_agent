In response to the massive humanitarian crisis caused by the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, UNHCR is working with national authorities, UN agencies, displaced communities and local and international partners to provide urgently needed assistance.
In Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, Artem’s home was severely damaged by shelling. Thanks to UNHCR’s NGO partner Angels of Salvation, skilled workers helped restore part of his shelter, allowing him to stay warm despite the destruction.

War in Ukraine deepens humanitarian crisis amid escalating attacks
The armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation entered its fourth year in 2025, with no ceasefire or political resolution in sight. Humanitarian needs have deepened as intensified attacks cause significant civilian casualties and drive new displacement. By September
12.7 million people inside Ukraine required humanitarian assistance
Civilian casualties rose by 31% compared to 2024, and since February 2022, at least
14,383 civilian deaths and 37,541 injuries have been documented.
Donors – governments, business, and private individuals – have been incredibly generous over the past year. This must be sustained if we are to provide people with the support they urgently need today and for the coming year. I hope all our donors will continue to enable the response to these humanitarian needs.

What is UNHCR doing to help?
UNHCR is responding by leading the Protection and Shelter/NFI Clusters in Ukraine, providing urgent protection and assistance to evacuees and war-affected people, and supporting early recovery and durable solutions for IDPs and returnees.
We are scaling up cash assistance for winter needs, shelter repairs, and energy support, and has launched a social facilitator programme to connect vulnerable displaced and returned people with social services.
Regionally, UNHCR coordinates the 2025–2026 Regional Refugee Response Plan with 200 partners across ten countries, focusing on life-saving protection, socio-economic inclusion, and strengthening national systems.
In Romania, priorities include legal aid, child protection, and employment access; in Bulgaria, socio-economic inclusion through community hubs; in Poland, strategic investment in refugees’ human capital through legal status, social protection, and employment pathways; and in the Republic of Moldova, transition to national systems and localization.
