The release marks a departure from typical Vatican philatelic traditions. The Holy See’s postal service usually focuses on Catholic holidays, national churches, or religious figures and local saints, typically avoiding contemporary political context.
On the new stamp, the Kyiv cathedral is shown as a dark silhouette against an orange evening sky, a reference to the power outages caused by the war.

Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church attended the presentation ceremony in the Vatican, describing the stamp as a “great moment of consolation.”
“We truly feel the support of the Holy See for this special attention to our history, to our life at this tragic moment of war,” he stated.

The stamp also commemorates the 30th anniversary of the restoration of the Kyiv Catholic Diocese following the collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the 12th anniversary of the cathedral’s construction.
Earlier, Pope Leo XIV
expressed
Speaking to journalists outside his residence in Castel Gandolfo, the Pontiff lamented the lack of a temporary truce and issued a heartfelt appeal to “people of good will” to respect at least the holy day as a time of peace.
