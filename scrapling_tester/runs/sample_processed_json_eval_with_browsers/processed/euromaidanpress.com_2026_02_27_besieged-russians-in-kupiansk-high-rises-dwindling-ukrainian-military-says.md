Illustrative photo. A screen shows Ukrainian soldiers watching a fatal drone strike on a Russian soldier who was attempting to cross a field in the vicinity of Kupiansk, at a drone command centre in an undisclosed location of Ukraine, on October 7, 2025. Devastated by years of Russian attacks, the nine-storey buildings that dot the skyline of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine now “stand like black candles”, local Vitaly Bardas recalled. Having been captured by Russia on the first day of its 2022 invasion, then retaken by Ukraine in a stunning counter-offensive months later, the logistics hub is now once again in Moscow’s crosshairs.

Besieged Russians in Kupiansk high-rises “dwindling,” Ukrainian military says
Months after Ukrainian forces encircled a Russian incursion into Kupiansk, the besieged occupiers are being hunted down with no prospect of relief.
Ukrainian signals intelligence detected about 20 active Russian radio call signs in the besieged high-rises on 25 February, Viktor Trehubov, spokesman for Ukraine's Joint Forces Group,
told
individual transmitters detected through signals intelligence
Trapped occupiers are concentrated in several apartment blocks near the city hospital on Kupiansk's northern edge. They are "just slowly ending there," Trehubov said. The actual number of soldiers is somewhat higher than 20, on the order of several dozen, consistent with
previous
"These are several high-rises, in which about 20 active Russian call signs were detected yesterday. They are just slowly dying off there."
The slow death of Russia's Kupiansk gamble
The numbers tell a story of steady attrition. In late November 2025, Russian General Sergei Kuzovlev
told
"I went to Kupiansk myself to show the world that Putin is lying,"
said
At the peak of the incursion, an estimated 200–300 Russian soldiers occupied parts of the city. Intercepted radio traffic
indicated
Supply lines were cut months ago. Drones are their only lifeline—and those carry little.
A city that refused to fall
Before the full-scale invasion, Kupiansk was a quiet railway hub of about
27,000 people
liberated
What followed was
22 months of grinding Russian attempts to retake it
13,000 soldiers
Moscow ordered Kupiansk taken by February 2026. The deadline passed. Its last troops survive on drone-dropped supplies in apartment blocks they can't leave.
Broader pressure continues
Russian forces are also pushing toward
Lyman, Stavky, and Yampol
constant enemy attacks on infrastructure and logistics routes
Fighting continues in
Sumy Oblast
