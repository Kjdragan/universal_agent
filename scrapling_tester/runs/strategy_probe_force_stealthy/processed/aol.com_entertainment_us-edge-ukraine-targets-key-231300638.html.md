RUSSIA-DAILY LIFE
Ukraine's recent attacks on the Russian port of Novorossiysk displeased the U.S. State Department, as the fallout has impacted U.S. oil interests in Kazakhstan.
Ambassador Olga Stefanishyna,
Kyiv's chief envoy to Washington
"This reach-out was not

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium operates a pipeline from the Caspian coast in northwest Kazakhstan to the Novorossiysk port.
The pipeline handles much of the crude exports from three major Kazakh fields in which major U.S. energy companies, Chevron and ExxonMobil, have stakes.
On Tuesday, the G7 - an informal intergovernmental association of the world's leading industrialized nations - released a leaders' statement marking the fourth anniversary of the war.
The group reaffirmed their "unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty and independence."
The statement also praised President Donald Trump's efforts to negotiate a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine.

The U.N. General Assembly also passed a resolution on Tuesday voicing support for Ukraine, but the U.S. was one of 51 countries that abstained.
The U.S. had tried unsuccessfully to eliminate references to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity from that resolution.

U.S. deputy ambassador Tammy Bruce said the Trump administration supports an immediate ceasefire, but language on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would "distract" from peace negotiations with Russia.
Throughout the duration of U.S.-brokered peace talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained maximalist demands, insisting Kyiv pull its forces from four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed but never fully captured.
Trump has argued it's inevitable that Russia will win control of the Ukrainian territory and has pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make a deal to save lives.
Meanwhile, Zelensky said his country has stood firm against the onslaught of the much larger and better-equipped Russian army, which over the past year of fighting captured just 0.79% of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Russia now holds nearly 20% of Ukraine.
