How Bad Is Ukraine’s Humanitarian Crisis a Year Later?
A year after Russia’s invasion, Ukraine is suffering a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The outflow of millions of refugees has placed a strain on neighboring countries.

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than eight million people have fled the country, triggering Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. Nearby countries have taken in millions of displaced people, while international organizations have sent tens of billions of dollars in aid. But as the conflict continues in its second year with no end in sight, experts worry that host countries are growing fatigued.
What’s the current humanitarian crisis in Ukraine?
According to the UN refugee agency, more than
thirteen million people
8,983 civilians have died
Meanwhile, U.S. officials say Russian forces have
forcibly transferred
In addition, the war has taken a tremendous toll on Ukraine’s infrastructure. Russian air strikes have hit healthcare facilities, residential neighborhoods, and power plants,
leaving millions of people without electricity

Health officials also remain concerned about the spread of infectious diseases given the deterioration in health-care infrastructure. They warn that COVID-19 transmission remains high, with only 38 percent of Ukrainians fully vaccinated against the disease. In the Russia-occupied city of Mariupol, officials imposed a quarantine over fears of cholera and dysentery, while the UN human rights mission in Ukraine expressed concern regarding reports that Ukrainian prisoners of war
have contracted
Where are refugees going?
About 2.9 million people, or 35 percent of Ukrainian refugees in Europe, have headed east to Russia. Poland, already home to an estimated 1.3 million Ukrainians (both naturalized citizens and temporary migrant workers), has welcomed the second-largest amount, at more than 1.6 million. Most of the remaining refugees have fled to the Czech Republic, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, and
other European countries
The number of refugees leaving Ukraine has slowed somewhat after peaking in March 2022; since then, nearly six million
have returned home

How have countries responded to the crisis?
European Union (EU) officials immediately activated the bloc’s emergency
Temporary Protection Directive
pledged over $50 billion
Some European countries have set up temporary housing, hospitals, and reception centers to offer food, information, and medical supplies, while aid and civil society organizations have provided baby supplies and spare clothes. Others, such as Ireland, have waived all visa requirements for Ukrainians seeking refuge, and the Czech Republic has lifted its entry ban and COVID-19-related travel restrictions.
Still, experts are concerned about growing “refugee fatigue” in the year ahead as the war continues and Europe grapples with soaring energy prices, housing shortages, limited employment opportunities, and strained government budgets. These factors have led to increasing anti-immigrant sentiment, including
anti-government protests
welfare tourism
underscores the difficulties
Financial Times
The United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, accepted close to three thousand refugees through its refugee program, and made an estimated sixty thousand Ukrainian migrants eligible for
temporary protected status
What role have international organizations played?
Russia has used its veto to block UN Security Council action, but the broader UN General Assembly has
expressed widespread opposition
passed several resolutions
At the same time, almost a dozen UN organizations, including the World Food Program and the World Health Organization, have provided assistance on the ground in Ukraine. In 2022, the United Nations
allocated $192 million
Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court continues to investigate claims that Russian forces have committed war crimes, of which Ukrainian officials say they have documented more than
sixty-six thousand incidents
