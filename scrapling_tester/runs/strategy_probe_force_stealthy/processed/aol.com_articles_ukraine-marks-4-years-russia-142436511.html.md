Ukraine marks 4 years of Russia’s war, Zelensky says nation ‘not broken’

Tuesday marks the four-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowing his country will stay unified as the war continues.
“Our people did not raise a white flag — they defended the blue and yellow one,” Zelensky said in an
address to his people
Zelensky praised the Ukrainian armed forces, saying they “fought in a way that took your breath away” in the early period of the war. The conflict against Russia dates back to 2014, when Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized the seizure of Crimea.
Zelensky then recounted a list of the places, symbols and individuals marking the number of civilians killed by Russian strikes.
Last year was the deadliest year for civilians in Ukraine since 2022, with over 2,500 civilians killed and over 12,100 injured,
according to the United Nations
according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies
“Men do not fight like this. People do not act like this,” Zelensky said, referring to Russia. “Ukrainians will not forget it. Let this footage be seen by everyone who has no pangs of conscience, by all who still extend a hand to Russian evil and still buy Putin’s oil.”

“On this grim anniversary, the Coalition of the Willing stands with Ukraine,” von der Leyen
wrote on social platform X
“We are working on robust security and prosperity guarantees — together with our US partners, solidly anchored in Ukraine’s EU path.”
The U.S. did not send a representative to Ukraine, as all but one member of President Trump’s cabinet will be in the House chamber Tuesday night for the
State of the Union address
told The Hill
The four-year mark of the war comes a day after a
joint report
Kremlin spokespersonn Dmitry Peskov, meanwhile, told reporters Tuesday the invasion would continue as the “goals haven’t been fully achieved yet,”
according to CBS News and Agence France-Presse
