Earlier, in a defiant message to his people, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Putin had not

The Ukrainian leader used a televised address on Tuesday to say that “Putin has not achieved his goals”, and that his country has preserved its independence and “
will do everything to achieve peace and to ensure justice
The UK defence secretary John Healey also hit out at Putin, saying the war had been "four years of failure” for him.
The prime minister used an address to his cabinet on Tuesday morning to praise the "incredible resilience" of Ukraine and warned the conflict was not “a remote” one happening “a long way away from the United Kingdom”.
"It's about our values of freedom, democracy and the right of a country to decide for itself what it does, which is democracy and sovereignty," he said.
The impact of the war was being felt in households across the UK because of the spike in energy prices since the invasion, he added.
"They are still 40 per cent higher than they were before," he said. “So, every family is feeling it. And how and when this conflict ends is going to affect everybody in the United Kingdom for a very long time, which is why it is so important we make sure that it's a just and lasting peace."
But, he insisted, "it is Putin who is standing in the way" of that outcome.

Asked for his reflections on the fourth anniversary of the war, Mr Healey said: "This is a war he thought he would win in a week; he has lost more than a million men during that time, and Russia has been fighting in Ukraine for longer than the Soviet Union was fighting Germany during the Second World War.
"Today, four years on, Ukrainians are fighting with just the same courage, just the same defiance, and our job, our duty, as allies of Ukraine is to stand by them, support them in their fight for today, but also work to secure the peace for tomorrow. That is my mission.
Asked if he agreed with Ukraine's Mr Zelensky's claim that the "beginning of the end" of the war is afoot, Mr Healey said: "I want to make 2026, like President Zelensky does, the year that this war ends, that we can bring peace. The UK is ready to play a part in securing that peace for the long term."
To mark the anniversary, the government has also put together a £5m package to support justice and accountability work in Ukraine,

Russia’s bombardment of Ukraine continued over the weekend, with a barrage of missiles and drones killing one person in Kyiv and striking the country’s energy grid.
Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, have said that the next round of talks aimed at ending the war could come as early as the end of this week.
