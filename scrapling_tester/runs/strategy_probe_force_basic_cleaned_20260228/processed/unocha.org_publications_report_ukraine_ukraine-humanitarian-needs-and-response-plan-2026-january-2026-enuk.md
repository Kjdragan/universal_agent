Foreword by the Humanitarian Coordinator
As I write this foreword, I recall my trip in late November 2025 to Druzhkivka, a town in Donetska Oblast, where I accompanied an evacuation mission organized by a local partner to bring a family with three children to safety. Once a lively community of tens of thousands, it is today almost a ghost town. We passed street after street of utter destruction. Homes and civilian infrastructure were flattened to the ground; for many, only the skeletal frames remain with shattered windows and roofs blown away.
Almost 4 years after the full-scale invasion by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, we must avoid romanticizing “resilience”.
Ukrainians have shown extraordinary courage, but they should not be expected to endure the unendurable without consistent, principled support
As the war continues, humanitarian needs in Ukraine have deepened rather than decreased
The year 2025 has been devastating for humanitarian workers in Ukraine: eight colleagues were killed, four of them while on duty, and 47 were injured in attacks that also damaged evacuation vehicles, warehouses and aid trucks. There are no signs that 2026 will be any safer.
At its core, this remains a protection crisis
We also know that
the war’s impact will long outlive the current emergency and humanitarian phase
Given the scale of needs and the reality of shrinking humanitarian resources, we must make deliberate and difficult choices to prioritize humanitarian support for those most in need.
The 2026 Plan adopts an issue-based approach, organized around four strategic priorities
With an estimated 10.8 million people in need,
humanitarians aim to reach 4.1 million of the most vulnerable, prioritizing those experiencing the most severe conditions
this Plan is about the most vulnerable people
Against all odds, local organizations continue to deliver most humanitarian work, often at great personal risk. Their leadership and knowledge of affected communities are essential and impactful in an increasingly localized response. It will remain a priority of the Humanitarian Country Team to agree and implement further practical steps to advance the localization agenda. As we bring the Global Humanitarian Reset into Ukraine’s context, we remain committed to ensuring that ‘accountability to affected people’ is reflected through concrete action. Putting people at the centre requires more comprehensive engagement than hotlines or complaint mechanisms alone.
I urge all humanitarian, development and governmental partners
to work together around our shared values and key identified strategic priorities
As a displaced woman from Donetska Oblast told us in her new community in Kharkivska Oblast: “I wish to be able to stay here and live a normal, peaceful life without fear of being uprooted once again”. Her words remind us why we do this work and why we must keep going. And with her and countless others, we long for the day when the weapons will fall silent, and we can focus on supporting the country to recover and rebuild with justice and dignity.
