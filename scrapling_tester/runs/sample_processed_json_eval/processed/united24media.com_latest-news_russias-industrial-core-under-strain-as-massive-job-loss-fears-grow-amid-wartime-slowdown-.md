Russia’s war-driven economy is facing serious pressure from sanctions and falling income. In the Nizhny Novgorod region, a major center for defense and car manufacturing, businesses are struggling.
Local industrial groups say the situation is causing “serious concern” and have asked the government for urgent help,

Investment and production have dropped sharply over the past year. Large state companies like Rostec and Roscosmos are not paying their bills on time. This has left local businesses with over $1.3 billion in unpaid invoices. To stay open, many firms are taking out loans with interest rates higher than 20%.
The financial crisis could lead to 20,000 job losses in the region by the end of the year. Some major companies have already started cutting working hours to save money. This is a big change from last year when the region had almost no unemployment.
While the Kremlin is spending heavily on Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many regions are facing growing budget gaps. Nizhny Novgorod expects a deficit of $387.6 million this year.

Sanctions have also hurt the region’s car industry. GAZ Group, which once worked with European brands, saw sales fall by 33% last year.

Earlier, David O’Sullivan, the European Union’s special
envoy
Despite Russia’s efforts to maintain its military campaign, oil revenues had fallen sharply, inflation had hovered near 6%, and interest rates had climbed to approximately 16%.
O’Sullivan also highlighted that the EU had successfully targeted Russia’s shadow fleet and tightened controls on sensitive components found in weapons systems, leading to a critical state for the Russian economy as it faced the pressure of the full-scale invasion.
