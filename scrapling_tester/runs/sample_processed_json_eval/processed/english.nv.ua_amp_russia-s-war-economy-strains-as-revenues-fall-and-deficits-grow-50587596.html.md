Russia’s war economy faces mounting strain as revenues fall — Bloomberg
Business
27 February, 02:20 PM
Russia’s war-driven economy is facing growing pressure from sanctions and declining revenues, with the impact increasingly felt in regions that previously benefited from soaring military spending,
Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27.
The strain is becoming visible in regions such as Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, a key industrial hub home to major defense enterprises and a large automobile plant.
In a letter sent to a senior regional official, a local industrial association warned of mounting difficulties for companies, including a sharp decline in investment, profits, orders and production over the past year.
If conditions fail to improve, up to 20,000 people in the region could lose their jobs in the second half of the year, according to the report. Bloomberg noted that several large companies, including firms deemed systemically important to Russia’s economy, have already reduced working hours to cut costs.
More than 80 Russian regions are grappling with widening budget deficits, forcing them to rely more heavily on transfers from the Kremlin, even as Moscow prioritizes war spending.
Regional governments, many of which have long depended on federal subsidies, are increasingly taking out high-interest loans to plug budget gaps, Bloomberg reported.
At the same time, businesses are gradually exhausting financial reserves that had helped sustain operations. As a result, companies may be forced to scale back production, lay off employees or declare bankruptcy.
European officials familiar with developments in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast say the situation reflects broader economic problems facing Russia. They believe the strain could complicate President Vladimir Putin’s ability to sustain the war against Ukraine and weaken the Kremlin’s position in potential negotiations.
Bloomberg also noted that Moscow has floated the prospect of major economic deals to U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration while seeking maximum concessions in stalled peace talks, which have faltered over Putin’s territorial demands.
Russia’s oil and gas revenues in 2025 fell to their lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Russian government has acknowledged that the federal budget could face a significant shortfall in early 2026 due to lower-than-expected energy income.
Ukrainian intelligence has said the financial condition of Russia’s medium and large enterprises continued to deteriorate, highlighting growing imbalances in the corporate sector.
More than half of Russia’s large companies ended 2025 with declining profits, cut or froze investment projects, and many are preparing workforce reductions.
On Feb. 24, 2026, reports emerged that about 300 companies in Russia were preparing to shut down.
