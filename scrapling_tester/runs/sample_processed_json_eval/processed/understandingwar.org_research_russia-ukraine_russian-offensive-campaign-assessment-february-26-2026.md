Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, February 26, 2026
Toplines
Russia launched another massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine on the night of February 25 to 26, primarily targeting energy infrastructure.
The appearance of ballistic, cruise, and anti-ship missiles in the February 25-26 strike package is reflective of a wider pattern in Russia’s strike campaign. Russia has launched strike packages with 25 or more missiles five additional times in February 2026, most recently on February 22. Russian forces often launch no or few missiles for multiple days in a row before launching strike packages with a significantly higher quantity of missiles, likely stockpiling missiles between strike series to maximize damage by launching several missiles alongside a large quantity of drones to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses.[5] Russian forces have also modified their drones and missiles to inflict more damage, including by equipping Shahed drones with mines and cluster munitions, and such measures have disproportionately affected civilian and energy infrastructure.[6] Russia also launches these larger strike packages to coincide with the days before and after bilateral and trilateral peace negotiations.[7] Russia notably launched this most recent strike package on the eve of bilateral US-Ukrainian talks on February 26 in Geneva. Russia’s increasingly large and diverse strike packages continue to highlight the critical importance of Western assistance in bolstering Ukraine’s air defense capabilities, both with high-end US-made Patriot air defense systems that can effectively counter Russian ballistic missiles and other lower-end forms of air defense, for a holistic, well-equipped air defense umbrella.[8]
The US and Ukraine continue bilateral engagements as part of ongoing peace negotiations.
Ukraine’s and SpaceX’s efforts to shut off Russian forces’ access to Starlink terminals continues to disrupt Russian drone operations across the frontline.
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) remains a critical enabler of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

A Russian fiber-optic first-person view (FPV) drone reached the outskirts of Kharkiv City for the first time on February 25.
Russia is reportedly deploying elements of at least one newly re-formed military unit to the Kupyansk direction.
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) reportedly issued a warning to Chinese citizens in Russia about a law compelling service in the Russian military.
The PRC consulate’s warning is an indicator that the PRC may be concerned that Russia will coerce its citizens living in Russia into military service through this law.

Ukrainian forces recently advanced in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area. Russian forces recently advanced in northern Sumy Oblast, the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area, near Pokrovsk, and in western Zaporizhia Oblast.
We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.
Ukrainian Operations in the Russian Federation
Recent Ukrainian strikes have damaged Russian defense industrial and oil infrastructure.
Russian Supporting Effort: Northern Axis
Russian objective: Create defensible buffer zones in Sumy Oblast along the international border

The Kharkiv Oblast Prosecutor’s Office reported on February 25 that Russian forces reached Kyivskyi Raion on the northern outskirts of Kharkiv City for the first time with a fiber-optic FPV drone that flew into a tree.[51] Ukrainian Ministry of Defense (MoD) advisor on defense technology and drone and EW expert Serhiy “Flash” Beskrestnov reported on February 25 that these FPV drones pose a significant threat that Ukraine will need to counter through technological adaptation, as traditional EW detection methods will not be effective.[52]
Order of Battle: Drone operators of the Russian Black Raven drone detachment (reportedly of the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division, 20th Combined Arms Army [CAA], Moscow Military District [MMD]) are reportedly striking Ukrainian positions in the Kharkiv direction.[53]

Ukrainian forces maintained positions or recently advanced in the Kupyansk direction.
Refinement of areas under Russian claims: Geolocated footage published on February 26 shows Ukrainian forces clearing an area in western Kupyansk where Russian sources had previously claimed that Russian forces maintained positions.[56]
Russian forces attacked in Kupyansk itself; east of Kupyansk toward Pishchane; and southeast of Kupyansk toward Kurylivka and Kupyansk-Vuzlovyi on February 25 and 26.[57] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces counterattacked near Kupyansk, Radkivka (north of Kupyansk), and Sobolivka (west of Kupyansk).[58]

A Russian milblogger reportedly affiliated with the Russian Western Grouping of Forces refuted claims that elements of the Russian 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army [GTA], Moscow Military District [MMD]) seized Bohuslavka and claimed that the division is not advancing.[60]
Russian Subordinate Main Effort #3 – Donetsk Oblast
Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas, and advance into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast

Russian forces attacked near Lyman itself; northwest of Lyman near Novoselivka, Svyatohirsk, Yarova and Sosnove; north of Lyman near Drobysheve and Stavky; northeast of Lyman near Myrne; east of Lyman near Maslyakivka; southeast of Lyman near Ozerne, Yampil and Dibrova; south of Lyman toward Staryi Karavan; northeast of Slovyansk near Zakitne; east of Slovyansk near Kryva Luka, Kalenyky, Platonivka, and toward Rai-Oleksandrivka; and southeast of Slovyansk near Nykyforivka and Bondarne and toward Fedorivka Druha on February 25 and 26.[61]
A Ukrainian servicemember operating in the Slovyansk direction reported on February 26 that the Russian military command is deploying reinforcements to the Slovyansk direction, including recently enlisted servicemembers.[62] The soldier noted that these servicemembers include ex-convicts motivated by money and their release from prison. The Russian military command’s decision to deploy reinforcements in the Slovyansk direction is consistent with ISW’s assessment that Russian forces will likely prioritize seizing Ukraine’s Fortress Belt in 2026 and may indicate that Russian forces will focus on the Slovyansk direction in a spring offensive.[63]
An officer of a Ukrainian brigade operating in the Lyman direction reported on February 26 that Russian forces attempted to use light two-wheeled vehicles to attack in the direction under favorable weather conditions.[64] A Ukrainian servicemember operating in the Slovyansk direction reported on February 26 that Russian heavy bomber and FPV drone drops are insufficient to resupply servicemembers following infiltration missions.[65]
Ukrainian and Russian forces recently advanced in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area.
