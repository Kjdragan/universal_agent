Russia launched another massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine on the night of February 25 to 26, primarily targeting energy infrastructure.

[iii]
[iv]
The appearance of ballistic, cruise, and anti-ship missiles in the February 25-26 strike package is reflective of a wider pattern in Russia's strike campaign. Russia has launched strike packages with 25 or more missiles five additional times in February 2026, most recently on February 22. Russian forces often launch no or few missiles for multiple days in a row before launching strike packages with a significantly higher quantity of missiles, likely stockpiling missiles between strike series to maximize damage by launching several missiles alongside a large quantity of drones to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses.

Russian forces recently advanced in northern Sumy Oblast, the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area, near Pokrovsk, and in western Zaporizhia Oblast.
We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.
