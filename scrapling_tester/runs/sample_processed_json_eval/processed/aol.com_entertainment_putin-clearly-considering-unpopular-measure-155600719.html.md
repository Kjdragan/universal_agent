Putin 'clearly considering unpopular measure' - as Russia faces 'critical' issue

RUSSIA-VOTE-CAMPAIGN-PUTIN
Expert analysis has revealed Putin is being forced to prepare the Russian population for what is due to be a highly contentious "domestically unpopular" move.
Researchers from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) have said the limitations of Putin's ability to
recruit replacement troops
The think tank - based in Washington - insists the Kremlin is suffering "critical" financial and military problems highlighted by
Russia's casualty rate
The ISW says, even while in the swing of a full-scale war economy which spends over 7% of its annual GDP on the military according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Putin will struggle to find additional funds to "continue to pay the large cash incentives that it has used to generate the necessary number of volunteers."

Experts argue Putin is "clearly considering and preparing for domestically unpopular measures such as rolling involuntary reserve call-ups."
Turning to the propaganda campaign launched by Putin's regime, the ISW adds: "The care and aggressiveness with which Putin is taking such steps indicate the concern with which he contemplates his people's reaction to the measures he is considering."

Roughly one-fifth of Ukraine remains under Russian control four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Yet as front lines have largely solidified, Russia's territorial advances have slowed dramatically after seizing major portions of eastern and southern Ukraine during the conflict's early months - establishing a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014.
Estimates suggest Russia has recaptured merely 1.3 percent of Ukrainian territory through battlefield action since early 2023.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told February's Munich Security Conference that Russia has endured "crazy losses" in Ukraine, with approximately 65,000 soldiers killed or wounded over the past two months.
The Center for Strategic and International Studies calculated that Russian forces have lost an average exceeding 26,000 soldiers monthly, including those killed, injured, and missing in action. Total casualties are estimated at a minimum 1.2 million since 2022.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov disputed the figures: "I don't think such reports can or should be considered reliable information," he stated. "It is the Defense Ministry that is authorized to provide information on any losses during the Special Military Operation."
