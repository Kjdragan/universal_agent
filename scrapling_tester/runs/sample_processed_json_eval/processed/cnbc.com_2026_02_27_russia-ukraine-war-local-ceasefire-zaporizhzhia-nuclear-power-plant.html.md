Key Points
The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, on Friday said Russia and Ukraine agreed to a local truce to allow for repairs at Europe's largest nuclear power plant.
Russian forces have controlled Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant since the first few weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion in early 2022.
Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War think tank have said the fifth year of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has not started well for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia and Ukraine agreed to a local ceasefire to allow for repairs of the backup power lines to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to the United Nations' nuclear watchdog.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said in a short statement Friday that a truce had taken effect in southern Ukraine to enable the restoration of the 330-kilovolt supply line to Europe's largest nuclear power plant.
"Demining activities are ongoing to ensure safe access for the repair teams," IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi
said
The local ceasefire, which the IAEA said it had helped to secure, comes shortly after the
fourth anniversary
Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant since the first few weeks of the invasion.
Situated in the southeast of the country, the plant is Ukraine's largest and houses six of its 15 operational nuclear power reactors. It has recently been reliant on external power to sustain all essential nuclear safety functions.
Both sides have accused each other of
