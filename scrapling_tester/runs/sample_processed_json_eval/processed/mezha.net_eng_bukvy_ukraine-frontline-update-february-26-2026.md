Ukraine frontline update February 26 2026
Friday, 27 February 2026, 17:07
The Huliaipole direction saw the most attacks — 20 battles.
According to the
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, this morning the front line recorded 57 attacks by the enemy.
The enemy was most active on the Gulyaypole direction  –  20 attacks in the area of Gulyaypole, as well as in the directions of Dobropillya, Pryluky, Zaliznychne, Zelenyi, Varvarivka and the Gulyaypole area itself.
Five engagements remain active across different sectors of the front.
On the Pokrovsk direction, the enemy attempted to advance 15 times in the areas of Dorozhne, Bilytske, Rodynske, Shevchenko, Pokrovsk, Udachne, Molodetske and Novopidhorodne. One of the battles is still ongoing.
Chronicle of combat actions by direction
In addition, fighting continues on the Southern Slobozhanshchyna, Kupiansk, Lyman, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Kostyantynivka and Oleksandrivka directions.
On the Orikhiv and Prydniprovski directions, no active offensive actions by the enemy were recorded.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, on February 26 the front recorded 230 military engagements; in particular, on the Gulyaypole direction the enemy tried to advance to the positions of Ukrainian troops 35 times.
Forecasts and Analysts’ Assessments
Experts believe that this spring or summer Russia may attempt a new large-scale offensive – with a likely emphasis on the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk agglomeration and/or Orikhiv-Zaporizhzhia. Such assessments indicate a risk of renewed escalation on multiple fronts.
These forecasts emphasize that Russia has limited resources, and internal problems within the country are intensifying. By the end of winter, the defense forces were able to adjust the enemy’s actions: at the junction of Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, Russian units were pushed back from Pokrovsk and further  –  from Orikhiv.
According to official data from the staff, the counteroffensive in this sector continues.
On February 23, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi stated that on the Oleksandrivsk direction, since the end of January, the Air Assault Forces and adjacent units had regained control over 400 square kilometers of territory and eight settlements.
“Russia’s swan song on the front  –  it has too few resources left for an offensive, and internal economic problems in the Russian Federation are intensifying.”
–  Kostyantyn Mashovets
Ultimately, the situation on the front remains tense: the enemy continues shelling and attempts to advance in certain directions, while the defense forces focus on containing and repelling attacks, while also planning further actions to hold positions and strengthen defensive lines.
