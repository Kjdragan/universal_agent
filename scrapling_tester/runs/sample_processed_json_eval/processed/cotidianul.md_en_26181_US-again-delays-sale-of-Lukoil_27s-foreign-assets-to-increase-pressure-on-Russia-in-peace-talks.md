US again delays sale of Lukoil's foreign assets to increase pressure on Russia in peace talks

The United States has decided to slow down the process of selling the international assets of Russian oil giant Lukoil in an attempt to increase pressure on Russia in peace talks over the conflict in Ukraine, four sources familiar with the negotiations said, Reuters reports, quoted by news.ro.
According to an Office of Foreign Assets Control document reviewed by Reuters, OFAC will extend the deadline for completing transactions from February 28 to April 1.
It is the fourth postponement of this type, following sanctions imposed in October against the two largest Russian oil producers: Lukoil and state-owned Rosneft.
Trilateral talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine, held in Geneva, Abu Dhabi and Miami, have yet to produce significant progress. Discussions include sanctions on Russian oil producers and how they can be used as leverage to advance peace talks. A new round of talks is scheduled for March.
A US official said the extension was intended "to facilitate ongoing negotiations with Lukoil and support President Donald Trump's efforts to deprive Russia of the revenue it needs for its war machine and achieve peace."
According to US requirements, the sale of the assets cannot bring any immediate benefit to Lukoil, and all proceeds must be deposited in a frozen account under US jurisdiction.
The assets up for sale, valued at $22 billion, include oil fields, refineries and gas station networks from Iraq to Finland, and interest is high: over a dozen potential buyers have submitted bids.
Among them are companies such as ExxonMobil, the former owner of Pornhub, the American private equity fund Carlyle Group, Saudi Arabia's Midad Energy, billionaire Todd Boehly with investment bank Xtellus Partners and the United Arab Emirates fund Alliance Investment Partners.
Also, a partnership between Chevron and Texas-based Quantum Capital Group is in advanced discussions, but has not yet agreed on terms with Lukoil.
The sale process, initially managed exclusively by OFAC, was escalated to the White House, Treasury and State Department levels, with the direct involvement of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to three sources.
Tensions rose after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this month that his intelligence services had informed him of a $12 trillion economic proposal made by Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev to the Trump administration, a package that would include Lukoil assets, further complicating negotiations.
The White House, State Department, Treasury and Lukoil did not respond to requests for comment on the connection between the extension and the peace talks.
