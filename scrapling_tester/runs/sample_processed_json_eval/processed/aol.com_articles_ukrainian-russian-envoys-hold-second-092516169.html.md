Russia Ukraine War

(ASSOCIATED PRESS)
GENEVA (AP) — The latest U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Moscow and Kyiv over
Russia’s all-out invasion
The negotiations in Switzerland were the third round of direct talks organized by the U.S., after meetings earlier this year
in Abu Dhabi
“The negotiations were not easy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the talks broke up and he spoke briefly by phone from Kyiv with his negotiating team.
He earlier accused Russia of “trying to drag out negotiations" while it presses on with its invasion — an accusation he and European leaders have repeatedly made in the past.
Despite that, some progress was made on military issues although political differences remain deep, including over the future of land in eastern Ukraine that is occupied by the Russian army and that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to keep, Zelenskyy said.
The head of the Russian delegation, Putin adviser Vladimir Medinsky, told reporters that the two days of talks in Geneva “were difficult but businesslike.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that it’s “too early” to speak about the outcome of the talks. Putin has been receiving reports about progress in Geneva, he said.
Both sides said a new round of talks is set to take place.
US will help monitor any ceasefire
Zelenskyy described the military discussions as “constructive,” adding that the armed forces of both countries considered how any future ceasefire might be monitored.
“Monitoring will definitely be carried out with participation of the American side,” he said in a voice message shared in a media group chat on WhatsApp.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on social media that Washington’s push for peace in Ukraine over the past year has “brought about meaningful progress," without elaborating.
The two armies remain locked in battle on the roughly 1,250-kilometer (750-mile)
front line
bombards civilian areas
Hours after the first day of talks ended on Tuesday, Russian drones killed a woman and injured a 6-year-old girl and 18-month-old toddler in the southern Ukraine city of Zaporizhzhia, officials said.

Overnight, Russia launched one ballistic missile and 126 long-range drones at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian air force.
Europe is involved
Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian and American envoys in Geneva met with representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.
Europe’s participation in the process is “indispensable,” Zelenskyy said.
European leaders,
mindful of Putin's wider ambitions
Russia and Ukraine appear to still be far apart on their demands for a settlement.
Zelenskyy has offered a ceasefire and a face-to-face meeting with Putin. But Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement before committing to a truce.
Putin’s key goals remain what he declared when Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022: Ukraine must renounce joining NATO, sharply reduce the size of its army and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow’s orbit.
Additionally, Putin wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four eastern regions Moscow has occupied but doesn’t fully control.
Zelenskyy says Ukraine won't surrender land to Russia.
