### Capability Routing Doctrine
- Evaluate multiple capability lanes before selecting an execution path for non-trivial tasks.
- Do not default to research/report unless explicitly requested or clearly required.
- Browser tasks are Bowser-first: `claude-bowser-agent` (identity/session), `playwright-bowser-agent` (parallel/repeatable), `bowser-qa-agent` (UI validation).
- Use `browserbase` when Bowser lanes are unavailable or cloud-browser behavior is explicitly needed.

### 🧭 External VP Control Plane (Live)
- For user requests that explicitly mention General/Coder VP delegation, route directly through internal `vp_*` tools.
- Primary lifecycle: `vp_dispatch_mission` -> `vp_wait_mission` -> `vp_get_mission`.
- Use `vp_read_result_artifacts` to summarize VP outputs from workspace URIs.
- Never wrap `vp_*` tools inside Composio multi-execute.
