                    <h4>Foundation Model Funding Dominance</h4>
                    <p>Foundation model companies raised $80 billion in 2025, representing 40% of all AI funding—more than doubling from $31 billion in 2024. OpenAI and Anthropic alone captured 14% of global venture investment. The largest deal was SoftBank's $40 billion investment into OpenAI, marking it as the most valuable private company ever at $500 billion valuation.</p>

                    <p>Private equity and alternative investors led the largest amounts in 2025, with PE-led deals totaling $63 billion across approximately 300 rounds. By contrast, venture capital firms led $38 billion across 1,600 fundings. While VC was more active (leading 75% of deals), PE dominated the mega-rounds above $1 billion.</p>

                    <h4>Build vs. Buy: The Pivot to Purchasing</h4>
                    <p>In a significant shift from 2024, enterprises now purchase 76% of AI solutions rather than building them internally (up from 53% in 2024). This reflects the maturation of ready-made AI solutions that demonstrate immediate value. Companies are prioritizing rapid deployment over custom builds, accelerating time-to-production.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h4>AI Deal Conversion Rates</h4>
                    <p>AI buyers convert at nearly twice the rate of traditional software: 47% of AI deals go to production compared to 25% for traditional SaaS. This elevated conversion reflects strong buyer commitment and clear immediate value. Organizations surface an average of 10+ potential AI use cases but focus adoption on near-term productivity gains.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h4>Product-Led Growth Dominance</h4>
                    <p>Individual users drive AI adoption at 4x the rate of traditional software (27% vs. 7% PLG penetration). When accounting for "shadow AI" (employees using personal credit cards for tools like ChatGPT Plus), PLG-driven tools may represent close to 40% of application AI spend. Tools like Cursor reached $200 million in revenue before hiring a single enterprise sales rep.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h4>Startup vs. Incumbent Performance</h4>
                    <p>AI-native startups captured nearly $2 in revenue for every $1 earned by incumbents—63% of the application market, up from 36% last year. This dominance is strongest in agile departments like market research, sales, marketing, and product. Incumbents maintain stronger positions in IT and data science, where reliability and deep integrations outweigh speed.</p>

                    <p>Anthropic's dominance is driven by its position in the coding market, where it commands 54% market share compared to 21% for OpenAI. This is up from 42% just six months ago, driven by Claude Code's popularity. Anthropic has maintained an 18-month lead atop LLM leaderboards for coding, starting with Claude Sonnet 3.5 in June 2024.</p>

Just a week later, Anthropic widened the gap again with Claude Opus 4.5, resetting the high-water mark for code generation.

                    <h4>Healthcare AI: The Breakthrough Vertical</h4>
                    <p>Healthcare alone captures nearly half of all vertical AI spend—approximately $1.5 billion, more than tripling from $450 million the year prior. The ambient scribe market reached $600 million in 2025 (+2.4x YoY), minting two new unicorns (Abridge and Ambience) alongside market leader Nuance's DAX Copilot. Clinicians spend roughly one hour documenting for every five hours of care; scribes that reduce documentation time by 50%+ dramatically reduce administrative burden.</p>

                    <h4>Coding: The First "Killer Use Case"</h4>
                    <p>Departmental AI spending hit $7.3 billion in 2025, with coding representing $4.0 billion (55% of departmental spend). This makes coding the largest category across the entire application layer. Fifty percent of developers now use AI coding tools daily (65% in top-quartile organizations). Teams report 15%+ velocity gains as AI tools now span the entire software development lifecycle.</p>

                    <p>Beyond healthcare and coding, AI is gaining traction across underserved verticals. Legal has grown into a $650 million market led by companies like Eve. Creator tools reached $360 million. Government AI spending reached $350 million. These sectors historically defined by manual, unstructured workflows are now prime candidates for AI automation.</p>

                    <h4>Infrastructure Investment Scale</h4>
                    <p>The infrastructure layer captured $18 billion in 2025—up 2.0x from $9.2 billion in 2024. Hyperscalers have committed an estimated $300 billion-plus to capex in 2025 and increased that commitment for 2026. This massive investment reflects the voracious compute appetite of foundation model training and inference.</p>

Companies like Databricks, Snowflake, MongoDB, and Datadog have enjoyed significant re-acceleration as even AI-native app builders continue choosing existing platforms for data management, workflow orchestration, and operations monitoring.</p>

                    <h4>Federal Executive Order on AI</h4>
                    <p>On December 11, 2025, President Trump issued "Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence," seeking to position the U.S. as the global leader in AI innovation. The order establishes that "United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation," identifying state-level regulation as a barrier to national economic and security interests.</p>

                    <p>State lawmakers from both parties say they plan to keep passing AI laws despite the federal order. The attempt to preempt state law through conditions on congressionally authorized grants is likely to prompt independent legal challenges from state attorneys general and advocacy groups. California launched a 30-member AI council to guide state policy as a "counterweight" to federal efforts.</p>

                    <h4>Productivity Gains Materializing</h4>
                    <p>Early evidence suggests AI is delivering real productivity improvements. The St. Louis Federal Reserve found that users of generative AI tools reported saving an average of 2.2 hours per 40-hour workweek. A Microsoft study identified the top 20 jobs at greatest risk of automation, including telephone operators, translators, ticket agents, telemarketers, brokerage clerks, and customer service reps.</p>

                    <p>An MIT report estimated that 11.7% of the labor market could be automated by AI—representing about a 1.2 percentage point increase in annual productivity if occurred over a decade. The same report estimated around 100,000 jobs were lost due to AI in 2025, representing just 0.5% of all layoffs. This suggests measured rather than revolutionary employment impact.</p>

One telemarketing study found AI boosted productivity for skilled workers but reduced it for less-skilled workers. Another study found the opposite—less-skilled workers' productivity increased 30% versus 15% for more-skilled workers. A consulting study found AI increased errors by 19%, highlighting that results can be mixed.</p>

AI offers potential to restore this productivity growth, not through dystopian transformation but through steady, incremental improvements across the economy. As a general-purpose technology, AI could bring us closer to the 2.3% benchmark if it reaches sufficient scale and capability.</p>

Only 16% of enterprise and 27% of startup deployments qualify as true agents—systems where LLMs plan and execute actions, observe feedback, and adapt behavior.
