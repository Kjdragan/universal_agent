        <h2>Conclusion: The Reckoning Year</h2>

        <div class="executive-summary">
            <p><strong>2026: The Year of AI Reckoning</strong></p>
            <p>If 2025 was the year of AI hype, 2026 might be the year of AI reckoning. The technology's powerful capabilities are already driving advances, but the coming year demands rigor over hype. Key themes to watch:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evaluation over Evangelism:</strong> Standardized benchmarks, ROI measurement, and productivity tracking replace speculation</li>
                <li><strong>Integration over Innovation:</strong> Focus shifts from "what can AI do?" to "how do we implement AI effectively?"</li>
                <li><strong>Reality over Hype:</strong> Failed projects, modest impacts, and implementation challenges temper expectations</li>
                <li><strong>Global Competition:</strong> Chinese open-source models, AI sovereignty movements, and regulatory fragmentation define the landscape</li>
                <li><strong>Scientific Acceleration:</strong> AI co-scientist systems, quantum computing, and breakthrough discoveries accelerate human knowledge</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The bubble may not be popping, but it's unlikely to get much bigger. The question is whether organizations will learn from early failures and identify where AI can be applied successfully—or whether 2026 will bring a wave of disillusionment. One thing is clear: after years of fast expansion and billion-dollar bets, 2026 will mark the moment artificial intelligence confronts its actual utility.</p>
