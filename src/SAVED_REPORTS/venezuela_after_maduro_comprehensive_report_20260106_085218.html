        <h1>Venezuela After Maduro: Political Crisis and Transition Challenges</h1>
        
        <div class="summary-box">
            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces on January 3, 2026, marks a watershed moment in Latin American politics and U.S. foreign policy. This unprecedented military operation—which involved airstrikes on at least five military bases and the extraction of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores from Caracas—has created a complex political vacuum in a nation already devastated by economic collapse, humanitarian crisis, and mass migration. President Trump's declaration that the United States will "run" Venezuela until a "safe, proper, and judicious transition" can be achieved raises profound questions about international law, sovereignty, and the future of democratic governance in the region. This report examines the circumstances of Maduro's capture, the current leadership configuration under Delcy Rodríguez, the controversial role of the U.S. in Venezuela's political transition, international reactions, and the daunting challenges facing any effort to rebuild Venezuela's shattered institutions and economy.</p>

        <h2>1. Maduro's Capture: Operation and Legal Context</h2>
        
        <p>The military operation that removed Maduro from power represents one of the most audacious exercises of U.S. military force in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989. According to multiple sources, U.S. special operations forces conducted precision strikes on at least five Venezuelan military bases—including targets in Caracas, La Guaira, Miranda, and Aragua states—before raiding Maduro's residence at Fuerte Tiuna, the principal military base of the Venezuelan army. The operation reportedly involved electronic warfare measures that jammed Venezuelan radars and electrical grids, while air defenses were destroyed to prevent resistance. Maduro and his wife were flown to the USS Iwo Jima and transported to New York to face federal charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation, and weapons violations.</p>

        <p>The legal justification for this operation remains highly contested. Trump administration officials frame the action as a law enforcement operation targeting a "narco-terrorist" organization, with Attorney General Pam Bondi stating that Maduro "will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil." However, international legal experts overwhelmingly condemn the operation as a violation of the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force against a state's territorial integrity or political independence. As the Atlantic Council notes, even if Maduro lacks widespread recognition as a legitimate head of state, international law generally affords sitting leaders personal immunity from prosecution in foreign domestic courts—a principle precisely designed to prevent politically motivated arrests. The operation has been described as meeting the definition of the "crime of aggression" under customary international law.</p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <strong>Casualties and Damage:</strong> The strikes and raid resulted in approximately 40 Venezuelan casualties, according to Al Jazeera. Targets included military bases, air assets, fuel depots, radar sites, and logistics hubs used by the Venezuelan military to project power.
        </div>

        <h2>2. Current Leadership Situation: Delcy Rodríguez and the Opposition</h2>

        <p>In the immediate aftermath of Maduro's capture, the Venezuelan Supreme Court—dominated by Maduro appointees—directed Vice President Delcy Rodríguez to assume the presidency, citing the "exceptional situation created by the kidnapping of Nicolás Maduro Moros." Rodríguez, a 56-year-old loyalist who has served in multiple high-level positions under both Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez, now finds herself in the precarious position of leading a government under intense U.S. pressure while lacking democratic legitimacy. Her initial public statements reflected this tension: while condemning Maduro's capture as "barbaric" and demanding his "immediate release," she also extended conciliatory overtures to Washington, inviting collaboration on "an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development."</p>

        <p>Trump has indicated that Rodríguez has expressed willingness to cooperate with U.S. demands. During a January 3rd press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump stated, "Marco is working on that directly. Just had a conversation with her, and she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again." However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has struck a more cautious note, emphasizing that the U.S. will make judgments based on Rodríguez's actions rather than her words. The U.S. is not recognizing Rodríguez as Venezuela's legitimate leader, with Rubio stating, "We don't believe that this regime in place is legitimate via an election."</p>

        <p>The Venezuelan opposition, meanwhile, finds itself in a paradoxical position. María Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader who escaped Venezuela in December 2025 after nearly a year in hiding, has called for Edmundo González—whom the opposition maintains won the July 2024 presidential election by a landslide—to assume the presidency. In a statement posted on social media, Machado declared that Venezuela had reached its "hour of freedom" and that Maduro now faces "international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations." However, Trump has publicly dismissed Machado as lacking the "support or respect within the country" to lead, a claim that political analysts and Venezuelan opposition supporters strongly reject. González, who fled to Spain in September 2024 following an arrest warrant, remains outside the country, complicating any immediate transition to opposition leadership.</p>

        <h2>3. U.S. Involvement and the Trump Administration's Plans</h2>

        <p>The Trump administration's approach to Venezuela marks a dramatic departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy rhetoric while drawing on deep historical patterns of American intervention in Latin America. Trump's declaration that the United States will "run" Venezuela until a "safe, proper, and judicious transition" can be achieved has evoked comparisons to the Monroe Doctrine and particularly to the 1989 invasion of Panama that removed Manuel Noriega. However, as Reuters notes, Trump's decision to attack Venezuela and arrest its president "marks a striking departure for a politician who long criticized others for overreaching on foreign affairs and vowed to avoid foreign entanglements."</p>

        <p>Behind the scenes, planning for a post-Maduro Venezuela has been underway for months. CNN reports that the Trump administration has been working on "day-after plans" focused on filling power vacuums and stabilizing the country if Maduro were ousted. These plans, closely held at the Homeland Security Council under Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, reportedly include multiple options for U.S. involvement ranging from economic and security support to more direct governance roles. However, there are significant divisions within the administration about the appropriate level of U.S. engagement, with some officials opposing "ramped up U.S. engagement" in the country while others advocate more assertive action.</p>

        <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has emerged as the central figure shaping U.S. policy toward Venezuela. According to CNN reporting, Rubio has spent months working closely with Miller to craft the strategy that culminated in the Maduro operation. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, has long denounced Maduro as a "narco-dictator" and has advocated for increased sanctions and pressure on the Venezuelan government. His current approach emphasizes economic coercion, particularly through maintaining an "oil quarantine" intended to choke Venezuela's oil revenues and pressure Rodríguez's interim government to cooperate with U.S. demands. Rubio has also emphasized counter-narcotics and the need to prevent Venezuela from serving as a base for U.S. adversaries including Russia, Iran, and China.</p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <strong>Key Players in U.S. Venezuela Policy:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have been the primary architects of the Venezuela strategy. Career diplomats and State Department experts have been largely isolated from the process, raising concerns about the lack of professional expertise in planning Venezuela's transition.
        </div>

        <p>Trump has repeatedly emphasized oil as a primary motivation for U.S. involvement. During his January 3rd press conference, he stated that U.S. oil companies would "go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure" and suggested that Venezuelan oil would be sold to other nations to fund the U.S. presence. However, energy experts note that Venezuela's oil industry is in a state of advanced decay, with production having fallen from over 3 million barrels per day in the late 1990s to roughly 934,000 barrels per day in late 2025. Rebuilding the sector would require years of investment and hundreds of billions of dollars, even in a favorable political environment—conditions that Venezuela currently lacks.</p>

        <h2>4. International Reactions and Sanctions</h2>

        <p>International reactions to Maduro's capture have been sharply divided along ideological and geopolitical lines, revealing deep fissures in global responses to U.S. military intervention. Left-wing governments across Latin America have unanimously condemned the operation as a violation of international law and Venezuelan sovereignty. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called the bombings and Maduro's capture "unacceptable" and "a grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty," warning that the action represents "yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community." Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry stated that dialogue and negotiation are "the only legitimate and effective means" for resolving differences and condemned "the U.S. military actions carried out unilaterally." Chile, Cuba, and Uruguay have also issued statements opposing foreign military interventions.</p>

        <p>Right-wing leaders have offered more support for Trump's actions. Argentine President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, posted "LA LIBERTAD AVANZA. VIVA LA LIBERTAD CARAJO" ("Freedom moves forward. Long live freedom, damn it") on social media. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino emphasized support for "democratic trials" and "the legitimate wishes of the Venezuelan people, as expressed emphatically at the polls." However, even some critics of Maduro, such as Chilean President Gabriel Boric, have condemned the operation as a violation of sovereignty and international law.</p>

        <p>Major global powers have also weighed in. Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry expressed "extreme concern" over Maduro's capture, calling it a "grave violation of sovereignty and international law." China expressed "shock" and condemned the use of force. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged resistance against what he framed as U.S. arrogance. European Union officials have taken a more measured approach, calling for restraint and respect for international law while acknowledging that Maduro "lacks legitimacy." European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated, "We stand by the people of Venezuela and support a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the UN Charter."</p>

        <p>The sanctions landscape remains complex. The U.S. has maintained comprehensive sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector since 2019, effectively cutting off the state's primary source of hard currency. In December 2025, the Treasury Department issued a new round of sanctions targeting four companies and oil tankers allegedly involved in transporting Venezuelan oil in violation of existing restrictions. These sanctions are part of what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called "President Trump's campaign of pressure on Maduro's regime." However, with Maduro now removed and a transitional government ostensibly in place, questions arise about when and how sanctions might be modified to support economic recovery without rewarding regime loyalists implicated in human rights abuses.</p>

        <h2>5. Future Transition Scenarios</h2>

        <p>Venezuela now confronts what analysts at Americas Quarterly have termed a "legitimacy trap": a political vacuum created by Maduro's absence, the non-recognition of his government, and the lack of a formally installed authority that is both effective and legitimate. The path forward is extraordinarily narrow and fraught with risks. Several scenarios have emerged from expert analysis:</p>

        <h3>Scenario 1: Power-Sharing Transitional Government</h3>
        <p>Some analysts advocate for a time-bound power-sharing arrangement that includes elements of the existing political elite, opposition forces, and international advisors. This approach would aim to preserve enough continuity to maintain relative stability while creating space for reform. However, this scenario risks entrenching Maduro loyalists and validating what the Atlantic Council's Geoff Ramsey calls "stability without legitimacy," which "is merely controlled stagnation." Moreover, many opposition supporters view any accommodation with regime figures implicated in abuses as morally unacceptable.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 2: Opposition-Led Transition Based on 2024 Election</h3>
        <p>The Venezuelan opposition maintains that Edmundo González, who won the July 2024 presidential election according to independent vote tallies collected by opposition activists, should assume the presidency with María Corina Machado serving as vice president. This approach would be grounded in the only clear source of democratic legitimacy available: the 2024 election results. However, as Americas Quarterly notes, implementing this scenario faces enormous practical obstacles. The Venezuelan military, after twenty-five years of politicization under Chávez and Maduro, remains deeply suspicious of the opposition and may resist sudden transfer of power. Moreover, the opposition lacks experience governing after years of exclusion from state institutions and has limited capacity to immediately administer a country of 30 million people with crumbling infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 3: Prolonged Interregnum Under U.S. Oversight</h3>
        <p>Trump's statements about "running" Venezuela suggest a scenario in which the U.S. maintains significant control over Venezuelan governance for an extended period, possibly through a combination of economic coercion, military pressure, and direct involvement in key sectors like oil production. However, this approach faces enormous obstacles. As Brookings experts warn, "leadership decapitation does not automatically produce regime change, which requires reprogramming a country's institutions, including its military, in order to change the country's behavior." The U.S. lacks the military footprint necessary for large-scale governance—no large-scale ground force has been assembled—and there is little appetite among the American public for another open-ended nation-building mission after Iraq and Afghanistan. Moreover, maintaining Maduro loyalists in power while dismissing the opposition could provoke popular unrest and undermine the very stability the U.S. seeks to establish.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 4: Fragmentation and Conflict</h3>
        <p>The darkest scenario involves the descent of Venezuela into protracted guerrilla conflict or civil war. If regime remnants reject negotiation and fragment, armed colectivos, criminalized military units, and narco-linked factions could wage asymmetric warfare, turning parts of the country into contested zones. As Alex Plitsas of the Atlantic Council warns, this could "prolong civilian suffering long after the regime's formal collapse." This scenario would likely trigger massive new refugee flows, destabilize neighboring countries, and create a pernicious security threat that could draw in regional actors or require U.S. military intervention on a much larger scale.</p>

        <h2>6. Humanitarian and Economic Implications</h2>

        <p>Venezuela's humanitarian crisis predates the current political crisis but now risks entering a new and even more dangerous phase. The economic collapse over the past decade has been staggering: the country's gross domestic product shrank by roughly three-quarters between 2014 and 2021, while annual inflation reached 130,000 percent in 2018. The Council on Foreign Relations notes that Venezuela "suffered economic collapse, with output shrinking significantly and rampant hyperinflation contributing to a scarcity of basic goods, such as food and medicine." Nearly eight million Venezuelans—approximately one-quarter of the population—have fled the country, creating one of the largest displacement crises in the world without a conventional war.</p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <strong>Humanitarian Statistics:</strong> According to CFR, Venezuela's GDP contracted roughly 80 percent over the last decade—the largest peacetime collapse recorded in modern history. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees reports nearly 7.9 million Venezuelans have left the country. About 50 percent of Venezuela's 28 million residents live in poverty.
        </div>

        <p>The immediate humanitarian needs remain overwhelming. Brookings experts estimate that nearly 8 million Venezuelans are in acute need of assistance, while basic infrastructure—including electricity grids, water systems, and transportation networks—is severely deteriorated. Any credible stabilization effort will require massive resources. Marcela Escobari of Brookings estimates that stabilization will require "an IMF-anchored package of over $50 billion over 18–24 months, combining balance-of-payments support, fiscal financing and debt restructuring, as well as parallel World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank programs." This must be paired with large-scale humanitarian assistance and support for the nearly 8 million Venezuelans who may eventually seek to return home.</p>

        <p>Rebuilding Venezuela's oil industry—the country's primary export and the source of nearly two-thirds of government revenue before the collapse—presents particularly complex challenges. Venezuela holds the world's largest proven oil reserves at approximately 303 billion barrels, more than Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels. However, production has plummeted from over 3 million barrels per day in the late 1990s to roughly 934,000 barrels per day in late 2025. Chronic mismanagement, politicization, underinvestment, and U.S. sanctions have hollowed out the industry. Years of capital flight, loss of technical expertise, and decaying infrastructure have left PDVSA, the state oil company, struggling to maintain even basic operations.</p>

        <p>Energy experts caution against expectations of a rapid recovery. Carole Nakhle of Crystol Energy notes, "The collapse predates sanctions. Chronic mismanagement, politicisation and underinvestment weakened the industry long before restrictions were imposed." Restoring production to its peak would require years and billions of dollars in investment—and would demand a stable political environment that Venezuela currently lacks. Moreover, Venezuela's oil consists primarily of heavy crude similar to Canada's tar sands, which is expensive and complex to produce. While U.S. Gulf Coast refineries were originally built to process this type of oil, global markets are currently oversupplied, and adding heavy Venezuelan crude would likely push prices lower, potentially hurting Canadian producers.</p>

        <h3>The Human Dimension</h3>

        <p>Beyond the statistics, the human toll of Venezuela's crisis is profound and ongoing. Venezuelans who fled the country have watched the dramatic events of January 2026 with mixed emotions. In communities like Doral, Florida—where more than one-third of residents are of Venezuelan descent—celebrations broke out as news of Maduro's capture spread. "After so much suffering and what we've been through, including the rigged elections, we're happy he was captured," Johan Brito, a 30-year-old from Puerto Cabello who has been in the U.S. for five years, told Bloomberg. "We can have better lives. I want to go back so bad because my family is there."</p>

        <p>However, these celebrations were tempered by uncertainties about Trump's plans. "I don't understand exactly what he means by 'running' the country, and I don't know if I want to know," Adelys Ferro, a human rights activist and advocate for Venezuelan immigrants, told Bloomberg. Venezuelans in the U.S. have complicated feelings about Trump, who helped remove Maduro while simultaneously scrapping humanitarian protections for Venezuelans and frequently accusing them of gang ties and criminality. "I'm celebrating the freedom of my country," Juan Gutiérrez, who wore a red Make America Great Again hat at the Doral gathering, told Bloomberg. Asked if he gives credit to the U.S. government, he said "of course, 100%, they've helped us a lot, despite receiving a lot of criticism."</p>

        <p>Inside Venezuela, reactions were more muted and fearful. Bloomberg reports that the streets of Caracas were quiet on January 3rd as Venezuelans lined up outside grocery stores and gas stations amid worries about the nation's future. The immediate challenge for ordinary Venezuelans remains day-to-day survival in an economy where basic goods remain scarce and inflation continues to erode purchasing power.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: An Uncertain Path Forward</h2>

        <p>The capture of Nicolás Maduro represents both an extraordinary achievement of U.S. military capability and a moment of profound danger for Venezuela and the region. Tactically, the operation was a success—demonstrating the United States' ability to project power in its hemisphere and remove a leader it deemed a threat. Strategically, however, the outcome remains far from certain. As Brookings expert Vanda Felbab-Brown notes, "leadership decapitation does not automatically produce regime change, which requires reprogramming a country's institutions, including its military, in order to change the country's behavior."</p>

        <p>The fundamental challenge confronting Venezuela is what analysts call a "legitimacy trap." Delcy Rodríguez, as Maduro's vice president and a loyalist, lacks democratic legitimacy. The opposition, led by María Corina Machado and Edmundo González, has legitimacy through the 2024 election but lacks the practical capacity to immediately govern a country with shattered institutions and a deeply compromised military. The United States has enormous leverage but lacks both domestic support for prolonged nation-building and international legitimacy for its intervention. Regional actors are divided, with some supporting Trump's actions and others condemning them as violations of sovereignty.</p>

        <p>What comes next will depend on the calculations of multiple actors: the remaining Maduro loyalists in Venezuela's government and military, who must decide whether to negotiate an exit or risk annihilation; the opposition, which must balance its legitimate claim to power against the practical constraints of governing; the Trump administration, which must determine how much resources and political capital to invest in Venezuela's transition; and the Venezuelan people, who have endured enormous suffering and must somehow find a path toward reconciliation and recovery.</p>

        <p>The stakes could hardly be higher. As the Royal United Services Institute warns, "Capturing Nicolás Maduro is not a shortcut to rebuilding a broken country." The path forward will require what seems in short supply: a commitment to legitimate governance, substantial international support, and a willingness to prioritize the welfare of the Venezuelan people over narrower political or economic interests. Whether Venezuela can navigate this narrow passage to a more democratic and prosperous future—or whether it will descend into further conflict and instability—remains the most pressing question facing the Western Hemisphere in 2026.</p>
