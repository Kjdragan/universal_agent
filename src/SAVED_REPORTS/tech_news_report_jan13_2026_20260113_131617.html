                <h2>OpenAI Acquires Health-Tech Startup Torch for $60 Million</h2>
                <p class="summary">
                    OpenAI has announced the acquisition of health-care technology startup Torch for approximately $60 million, marking another strategic move in the healthcare AI space. Torch was developing a "unified medical memory" system designed to consolidate patient health data across different vendors and formats into a single platform. All Torch employees will join OpenAI as part of the deal.
                </p>
                <p class="summary">
                    This acquisition comes just days after OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT Health, a new feature allowing users to connect medical records and wellness apps to the AI chatbot. Torch CEO Ilya Abyzov, who previously co-founded the health-tech startup Forward (which shut down in 2024), expressed enthusiasm about bringing their technology to ChatGPT's hundreds of millions of users who already ask health questions weekly.

                <h2>Amazon Escalates Office Monitoring with Badge-Tracking Dashboard</h2>
                <p class="summary">
                    Amazon has rolled out a new monitoring dashboard for managers that tracks not just employee office presence, but the exact hours spent in the office. The system identifies "Low-Time Badgers" (employees averaging less than four hours per day in-office over eight weeks), "Zero Badgers" (those who never badge in), and "Unassigned Building Badgers" (those consistently working from different buildings than assigned).
                </p>
                <p class="summary">
                    This escalation in surveillance follows Amazon's strict five-day return-to-office mandate implemented in January 2025. The dashboard updates daily at 5 PM PT and tracks data over an eight-week period. Amazon is not alone in these practices—Samsung, Dell, Bank of America, and JPMorgan have all implemented similar badge-tracking systems to enforce attendance policies.

                <h2>Trump Announces Microsoft Will Cover AI Data Center Energy Costs</h2>
                <p class="summary">
                    President Donald Trump announced that Microsoft will implement "major changes" this week to ensure American households don't bear the cost of the company's power-hungry AI data centers. "I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers," Trump wrote on Truth Social, emphasizing that big tech companies must "pay their own way."
                </p>
                <p class="summary">
                    The announcement comes as utility bills have climbed across at least 13 states due to AI infrastructure's massive energy demands, with some regions seeing electricity price spikes as high as 36%. Microsoft has already taken steps to address concerns, including scrapping plans for a data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin after local opposition, and signing a 20-year deal to purchase power from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant (set to reopen by 2027).

                <h2>"Are You Dead?" App Surges in Popularity Across China</h2>
                <p class="summary">
                    A morbid but practical smartphone app called "Are You Dead?" has become a viral sensation in China. Launched in May 2025, the app requires users to press a button every two days to confirm they are still alive. If two days pass without the button being pressed, the app automatically notifies an emergency contact that the user may need assistance.
                </p>
                <p class="summary">
                    The app addresses a genuine concern for people living alone or with limited social circles—the fear that if something happens to them, no one will know. According to the BBC, the app was developed by a small team in Zhengzhou, Henan, and the founders are now exploring a version specifically designed for elderly users in a country where over one-fifth of the population is over 60.
