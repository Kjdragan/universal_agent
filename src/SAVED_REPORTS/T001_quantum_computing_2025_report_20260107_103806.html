While significant technical challenges remain—particularly in error correction and scaling—the progress in hardware, software, and algorithm development is accelerating. The next 18-24 months will likely see the first demonstrations of genuine quantum advantage for practical problems, validating decades of research and investment. Organizations across industries should begin developing quantum readiness strategies, even as full fault-tolerant quantum computing remains several years away. The quantum computing revolution is no longer a question of "if" but "when" and "how fast."</p>
