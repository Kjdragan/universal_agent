The mission is **IN_PROGRESS** with 15% of reports completed (3/20). The research foundation is solid with comprehensive sources gathered.

## Estimated Completion Requirements
- Time: Additional 6-8 hours of focused work
- Token Budget: ~100,000+ tokens remaining for full completion
- Tasks: 17 reports + 20 PDF conversions + 4 email deliveries

## Recommendation
Given the mission scope, the most efficient path forward is to:
1. Complete remaining 2 reports for Batch 1
2. Convert Batch 1 to PDFs
3. Email Batch 1
4. Continue with Batches 2-4 sequentially

The research quality is high, sources are comprehensive, and report structure is professional. Ready to continue execution.
