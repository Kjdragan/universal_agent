    <h1>Electric Vehicle Research Report</h1>
    <p><strong>January 2026</strong></p>

    <div class="executive-summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>January 2026 marks a historic shift in the global electric vehicle industry: China's BYD has officially overtaken Tesla as the world's largest seller of electric vehicles. This changing of the guard comes amid significant technological breakthroughs in battery technology, including the debut of production-ready solid-state batteries and third-generation cell-to-pack (C2P) architectures that slash costs by up to 25%. The EV market continues its robust growth trajectory, with emerging markets driving global expansion and average EV ranges reaching 293 miles in 2025.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Major Industry Development: BYD Overtakes Tesla</h2>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Historic Shift in Global EV Leadership (January 2026)</h3>
        <p>China's BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles, marking the first time a Chinese automaker has claimed the global EV crown. This development comes after BYD delivered 4.6 million vehicles in 2025, positioning it ahead of Tesla in global EV sales.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Factors:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tesla sales down 9% year-over-year in 2025</li>
            <li>Elimination of federal EV incentives in the U.S. impacting Tesla more than competitors</li>
            <li>BYD's strong domestic China market position and aggressive international expansion</li>
            <li>Intensifying competition from European EV manufacturers</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Timeline Note:</strong> In 2011, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed BYD as a competitor. Fourteen years later, BYD has proven him wrong decisively.</p>
