# Satellite Count Summary (January 2026)

## Current Number of Satellites in Orbit

As of the most recent data available (March 2025), there are **14,904 satellites** orbiting Earth. This represents a significant increase of 31.54% since June 2023, reflecting the rapid expansion of satellite mega-constellations like SpaceX's Starlink. Of these, approximately 12,149 are actively operational satellites as of May 2025. The year 2025 set a new record with 4,517 satellites deployed into orbit—a 58% increase over 2024 launch numbers. Industry projections indicate the space sector is on track to launch approximately 58,000 satellites by 2030, though natural de-orbiting processes currently remove 1-2 Starlink satellites per day as they reach end-of-life.
