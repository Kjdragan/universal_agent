            <h2>⚡ Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>The past seven days have witnessed one of the most dangerous escalations of the nearly four-year Russia-Ukraine war. Russia's deployment of the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile, systematic targeting of energy infrastructure during freezing winter temperatures, and rejection of European peacekeeping proposals have dramatically heightened tensions. Despite a reported peace agreement being "90% complete," Vladimir Putin continues to stall negotiations while intensifying attacks on civilians. The humanitarian crisis has reached critical levels, with millions facing subzero temperatures without heat or electricity as winter weaponization becomes Russia's primary strategy.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <p><strong>Key Statistic:</strong> In the past year alone, over <strong>400,000 Russian soldiers</strong> have been killed, with total military losses exceeding <strong>1.2 million</strong> personnel since the invasion began.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Will the War End in 2026?</h3>
                <p>Analysts predict the war is <strong>unlikely to end in 2026</strong> because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Russia appears unwilling to make substantial concessions</li>
                    <li>Putin remains committed to offensive operations in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson</li>
                    <li>Neither side positioned for conclusive victory or collapse</li>
                    <li>Peace deal along current lines would threaten Putin's regime stability</li>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Russia's Strategic Calculus</h3>
                <p>Analysis suggests Putin views escalation as necessary for regime survival:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Securing Ukraine as independent state = "major political failure"</li>
                    <li>Would risk being viewed historically as "the man who lost Ukraine"</li>
                    <li>Domestic pressures: stagnating incomes, eroding elite loyalty, high casualties</li>

                    <li>Collapse in oil prices combined with strict sanctions</li>
