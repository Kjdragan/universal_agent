## Military Situation Analysis

### Frontline Status and Territorial Changes

#### Kupyansk - Strategic Flashpoint
Despite Russian Ministry of Defense claims that Russian forces "seized Kupyansk several weeks ago," evidence indicates Ukrainian forces have liberated **nearly 90% of the city** (ISW, Dec 17). Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets reported on December 19 that Ukrainian forces have **encircled up to two understrength Russian companies** in central and southern Kupyansk along both banks of the Oskil River (ISW, Dec 19).

President Putin attempted to discredit footage of President Zelenskyy's December 12 visit to southwestern Kupyansk as fake, claiming drones make approach impossible - a claim directly contradicted by visual evidence (ISW, Dec 19).

#### Russian Claims vs. Reality
During his December 19 Direct Line, President Putin made significantly exaggerated claims about Russian territorial advances:

| Claim | Reality (per ISW) |
|-------|------------------|
| Seizure of Siversk | NOT confirmed |
| Seizure of Vovchansk | NOT confirmed |
| 50% control of Lyman | Only 2.9% confirmed |
| 50% control of Hulyaipole | Only 7.3% confirmed |
| "More than half" of Kostyantynivka | Russian bloggers claim max 11% |

### 2025 Territorial Gains Assessment
According to ISW analysis, Russian forces have seized only **4,699.04 square kilometers in 2025** - an area slightly larger than Rhode Island (ISW, Dec 17). Russian Defense Minister Belousov claimed 6,000 square kilometers, but even this exaggerated figure represents less than 1% of Ukraine's territory.

**ISW Assessment:** It will take Russian forces **two or more years to seize the remainder of Donetsk Oblast** at great cost at current rates of advance and losses (ISW, Dec 17, 19).

### Ukrainian Strike Campaign Achievements

| Date | Target | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Dec 19-20 | 2x Su-27 fighters at Belbek Airbase, Crimea | Destroyed |
| Dec 19-20 | RSP-6M2 radar near Krasnosilske, Crimea | Struck |
| Dec 19-20 | Project 22460 patrol boat, Caspian Sea | Struck |
| Dec 19 | QENDIL shadow fleet tanker | Critically damaged |
| Dec 17 | Slavyansky Oil Refinery, Krasnodar Krai | 100 sq m fire |
| Dec 23 | Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, Krasnodar | Explosions/fire |

### Russian Air and Missile Campaign
Russian Defense Minister Belousov claimed strikes have disabled **over 70% of Ukraine's thermal power plants** and **37% of hydroelectric plants** (ISW, Dec 17).

**December Drone/ Missile Strikes:**
- Dec 16-17: 69 Shahed/Gerbera drones launched
- Dec 18-19: 160 drones launched (90 Shahed-type)
- One week total (Dec 22): ~1,300 drones, ~1,200 guided bombs, 9 missiles

### Force Generation and Manpower
- **Russian Claims:** 410,000 signed contracts in 2025 (~32,800/month)
- **Ukrainian Data:** ~34,600 Russian casualties/month (Jan-Nov 2025)
- **Assessment:** Recruitment not replacing losses; explaining reservist mobilization efforts

## Diplomatic Developments

### Miami Peace Talks (December 19-22, 2025)

**Structure:** Separate meetings with Ukrainian and Russian delegations (no direct Ukraine-Russia contact)
- **Dec 19:** US envoys Witkoff/Kushner met Ukrainian delegation + European representatives
- **Dec 20:** Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev arrived; no meeting with Ukrainian delegation

**Conflicting Signals:**

*Optimistic:*
- Trump: "We're closer now than we have been, ever"
- Witkoff: "Productive and constructive"; both sides "committed" to peace
- Zelenskyy: "Very close to a real result"

*Pessimistic:*
- Senator Vance: No confidence in deal; territorial concessions a "significant hold-up"
- Secretary Rubio: Solution "a ways off"
- Expert Daalder: Fundamental conflict "as big today as the day the war started"

### Putin's Maximalist Positions (December 19 Direct Line)

**Core Russian Demands - Unchanged Since February 2022:**
1. Complete Ukrainian withdrawal from Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson oblasts
2. Ukraine's abandonment of NATO membership aspirations
3. Ukrainian neutral status, demilitarization, "denazification"
4. International recognition of annexed territories
5. Lifting of all Western sanctions

These positions **directly contradict** the US-proposed 28-point peace plan (ISW, Dec 19).

### Security Guarantees Dilemma

| Ukrainian Position | Russian Position |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Seeks Article-5-like guarantees | Rejects any Western troops in Ukraine |
| Willing to abandon NATO for security guarantees | Non-negotiable: Ukraine must never join NATO |
| Requires robust Western backing | Demands neutral, demilitarized Ukraine |

### European Support and Financial Aid

**EU Package (December 18):**
- 90 billion euros ($105 billion) interest-free loan for 2026-2027
- Ukraine repays only if Russia pays reparations
- Loan backed by EU budget, not frozen Russian assets

**Ukraine's Financial Shortfall:**
- 45-50 billion euro ($53-59 billion) shortfall projected for 2026
- Without Russian-asset loan by spring, drone production cuts necessary

## Expert Assessments and Projections

### Ivo Daalder - Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO (Harvard Kennedy School)
- "The fundamental conflict is as big today as the day the war started"
- Ukraine-Russia alignment "as far away today as it has been in any time in the last four years"
- **Best realistic outcome:** Ceasefire along current line with international monitoring
- **Timeline for Russia reaching cost/benefit tipping point:** 2026 or early 2027

### Keir Giles - Chatham House
- Russia will only accept ceasefire if it believes it can **violate at will** and resume war at time of its choosing
- War aims are "incompatible" and "exceptional in terms of modern wars"

### Nathalie Tocci - Istituto Affari Internazionali
- "Extremely unlikely that a ceasefire is going to be reached now"
- Issues of territory and security remain unresolved

### Institute for the Study of War (ISW)
- **2+ years** needed for Russia to seize remainder of Donetsk Oblast
- Russia has entered "Phase Zero" - preparation for possible NATO-Russia war
- Actual Russian inflation **over 20%** vs. claimed 5.6-5.8%
