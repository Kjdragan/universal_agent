### Conflicting entropy-driven zwitterionic dry polymer electrolytes for scalable high-energy all-solid-state batteries
**Source:** Nature Communications, unknown

*   **Core Technology:** Researchers developed Zwitterionic Dry Polymer Electrolytes (ZPEs) using a "conflicting entropy strategy" to solve limitations of inorganic electrolytes (brittleness, interface issues) and traditional polymer electrolytes (low conductivity).
*   **Material Design:** Guided by Flory-Huggins theory, liquid zwitterionic monomers (ZM) were mixed with Li salts (specifically LiBETI) without solvents. High mixing entropy ensured a homogeneous mixture, while subsequent in-situ polymerization created aligned ion channels decoupled from the polymer backbone via reduced conformational entropy.
*   **Optimal Chemistry:** The study identified LiBETI salt (anion BETI⁻) as the optimal pairing for the zwitterionic matrix due to its low charge density and weak Li⁺ binding energy (119.81 kcal mol⁻¹), promoting high dissociation. The optimal ZM/LiBETI ratio was determined to be 1.0/1.5 (mol/mol).
*   **Performance Metrics:** The resulting ZPE achieved a high Li⁺ conductivity of 0.38 mS cm⁻¹ (25 °C) with a high Li⁺ transference number (0.78). It is nonflammable and thermally stable up to 300 °C.
*   **Full Cell Achievement:** When used in a pouch cell with a high-loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode (10.0 mAh cm⁻²) and thin Li-metal anode (N/P ratio = 1.0), the cell achieved a specific energy of **516 Wh kg⁻¹** and energy density of **1329 Wh L⁻¹**.
*   **Manufacturing Compatibility:** The liquid ZPE precursor was infiltrated into pre-fabricated porous cathodes (standard slurry-cast NCM811) and polymerized in situ. This "solid catholyte" approach is compatible with existing Li-ion manufacturing, reducing complexity compared to inorganic electrolyte processing.
*   **Transport Mechanism:** Unlike conventional polymer electrolytes relying on segmental motion, the ZPE utilizes an "ion-hopping" mechanism along directionally aligned, ordered ion channels (ordered phase estimated at 54%), enabling faster transport.
*   **Operational Conditions:** The pouch cells demonstrated stable cycling at practical commercial conditions of 25 °C and 0.5 MPa, avoiding the high pressure/temperature requirements typical of sulfide-based solid-state batteries.

### A scalable and long-cycle-life 600 Wh kg−1 solid-state lithium metal pouch cell
**Source:** Nature Communications, 2024-05-25

*   **Specific Energy Achievement:** Researchers developed an 11 Ah-class lithium metal pouch cell achieving a specific energy of **604.2 Wh kg⁻¹** (626.4 Wh kg⁻¹ excluding packaging), operating for over 100 cycles with 92.83% energy retention.
*   **Electrolyte Innovation (GMFN):** An in-situ gel-solid-state electrolyte was created by crosslinking monomers (PETEA, DAP, HFBMA) within a carbonate-based liquid electrolyte (MFN). This polymer network "anchors" free solvent molecules, suppressing parasitic reactions and gassing, while forming a robust CEI on the cathode.
*   **Anode Modification (BGPL):** A Bicontinuous Gradient Polymer Layer (BGPL) was applied to the Li-metal anode. This ~2.1 μm thick layer (combining poly-1,3,5-trioxane and PVDF-co-HFP) regulates Li⁺ flux for dense plating and provides moisture/oxygen resistance, allowing safer processing and preventing foil wrinkling.
*   **Cathode Compatibility:** The system utilizes a high-nickel Ni92 cathode (LiNi0.92Co0.06Mn0.02O2). The GMFN electrolyte significantly reduced gassing (CO₂, CO, O₂) compared to standard LP334 electrolyte and formed a thinner, inorganic-rich Cathode-Electrolyte Interphase (CEI).
*   **Manufacturing:** The process is designed for scalability; the BGPL coating allows for the roll-to-roll tape casting of Li foils, and the in-situ gelation is compatible with existing battery production lines.
*   **Safety Performance:** In nail penetration tests on 5 Ah-class pouch cells, the GMFN/BGPL cell remained intact without fire or thermal runaway, whereas the control cell with liquid electrolyte exploded.
*   **Failure Analysis:** Research indicated that in high-energy pouch cells (>500 Wh kg⁻¹), electrolyte depletion (drainage) is often the primary cause of failure within 100 cycles, rather than just the exhaustion of the thin Li-metal anode.

*   **Target Markets:** Smaller ASSB cells are ideal for medical devices, while larger battery packs target the electric vehicle (EV) sector, specifically for longer-range and faster-charging applications.
*   **Manufacturing Costs:** According to a report by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and National Energy Administration, sulfide electrolytes currently cost five times as much as liquid electrolytes.
*   **Scaling Requirements:** The NDRC estimates that 100,000 metric tons of sulfide production and dedicated recycling systems are required to bring costs down.
*   **Overall Price Premium:** Academic researchers indicate that material and manufacturing complexities currently drive ASSB costs up by approximately 30% compared to Li-ion batteries (based on per kWh benchmarks).
*   **Supply Chain Challenges:** Unlike the established Li-ion industry, ASSBs lack a mature global supply chain, large-scale mining for specific materials, and existing manufacturing equipment, requiring a significant infrastructure overhaul.
*   **Technical Hurdles:** Solid electrolytes are susceptible to interfacial instability where electrodes meet the electrolyte, causing resistive layers that increase internal resistance and reduce ion transport; mechanical stress from electrode volume changes during cycling can also crack the solid electrolyte.
*   **Precision Fabrication:** Solid electrolytes are often composed of multiple thin film layers requiring defect-free production; this necessitates controlled environments using physical vapor deposition (PVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), or advanced pressing techniques.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** ASSB manufacturing requires "dry-room facilities" because solid-state electrolytes are susceptible to moisture contamination, which can cause rapid battery deterioration.
*   **Innovations:** Dry battery electrode (DBE) methods are gaining traction (e.g., by Tesla) to eliminate solvents, reduce residual moisture risks, and cut energy costs; AI and machine learning are also being explored to optimize materials and parameters.
*   **Industry Adoption:** Major automakers including BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, and Tesla have announced plans to incorporate ASSBs into vehicles, though widespread adoption awaits the resolution of technical and supply chain barriers.
