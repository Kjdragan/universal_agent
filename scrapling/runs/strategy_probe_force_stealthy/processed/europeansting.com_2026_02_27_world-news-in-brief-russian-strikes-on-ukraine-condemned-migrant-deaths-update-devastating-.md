This article is published in association with
United Nations
The UN on Thursday condemned the latest attacks against civilians in Ukraine by Russian forces, reiterating that they always constitute a violation of international law “and must stop immediately.”
Briefing reporters in New York, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said any strike against civilians anywhere – or any civilian buildings or other infrastructure is “unacceptable and unjustifiable.”
“Between yesterday and the early hours of today, an overnight large-scale drone and missile attack across Ukraine and frontline hostilities resulted in dozens of residential buildings damaged in Kyiv, as well as in Kirovohradska, Kyivska, and Vinnytska oblasts.”
Power cuts
In the Odesa region, around 40,000 families were left without electricity, and in the Poltava region, damage to gas facilities disrupted power supply for around 20,000 families and businesses.
“Our humanitarian partners on the ground provided materials for basic repairs as well as first aid,” said Mr. Dujarric, adding that during January according to the UN and partners, nearly 7,000 people were evacuated from frontline areas in eastern Ukraine.
This week saw the beginning of the fight year of war in Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion on 22 February 2022. For a full recap of how the UN marked the anniversary, check out

Many migrants lose their lives crossing the Mediterranean sea in unseaworthy boats (file)
21 migrants a day died during 2025: UN migration agency
At least 7,667 people died or went missing while attempting to migrate last year, highlighting the need for greater global action to dismantle smuggling networks that exploit people on the move.
In fact, 21 migrants died every day in 2025, according to
new data
IOM
“The continued loss of life on migration routes is a global failure we cannot accept as normal,” said Amy Pope, the agency’s Director General.
Real toll likely higher
In 2025, at least 2,185 people died or went missing in the Mediterranean while 1,214 were recorded on the Western Africa/Atlantic route toward the Canary Islands – reflecting how sea crossings remained among the deadliest routes.
Despite year-on-year declines, the real toll is likely higher, as at least 1,500 additional people were reported missing at sea but could not be verified due to limited access to search-and-rescue information.
However, at least 270 human remains washed ashore in the Mediterranean in 2025 without being linked to any shipwrecks.
Furthermore, three vessels that had attempted to make the Canary Islands crossing were later found later drifting to Brazil and the Caribbean with the remains of 42 people on board.
Step up search and rescue
The agency also provided information from other regions including the Americas, where 409 deaths were recorded in 2025 – the lowest number since the start of data collection in 2014.
This is likely due to fewer people crossing through the perilous Darién Gap between Colombia and Panama, the US-Mexico border and other irregular routes,
IOM urged governments and partners to scale up coordinated search-and-rescue operations to prevent further loss of life, strengthen international cooperation to dismantle criminal networks, and expand safe and regular migration.

IOM supports response efforts following deadly rains in southeastern Brazil
Heavy rains in the state of Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil this week has caused loss of life, displacement and significant damage.
The record rainfall caused floods which reportedly displaced more than 3,500 people in three locations – Juiz de Fora, Matias Barbosa and Ubá – in a region characterized by hills and mountainous terrain.
The UN migration agency is
supporting the authorities
As an immediate measure, essential relief items will be delivered to municipal authorities in Juiz de Fora on Friday.
Shelter and services
IOM is also mobilising a team to provide technical support for the management and organization of shelter facilities in partnership with a national task force, among other assistance.
“At moments like this, ensuring that affected communities can access timely assistance, safe shelter and essential services is critical,” said Paolo Caputo, Chief of Mission in Brazil.
IOM has been in Minas Gerais since 2019. The agency works in partnership with the authorities to promote the integration of migrants and support the voluntary return and re-integration of Brazilian nationals.
In 2024, IOM supported flooding response in another state, Rio Grande do Sul, where more than 1,000 people were hosted for nearly a year in three reception centres.
