Crisis in Ukraine
Ukraine war 4-year mark: Civilian deaths, injuries rise as funding falls to record low
February 23, 2026
As Ukrainians face a fifth year of full-scale war, CARE is warning of the long-lasting and dangerous impact of living just to survive while lifelines are cut.
In response, Michael McGrath, CARE Ukraine’s Country Director, said:
“After four years of full‑scale war, people describe to us endless nights spent half‑awake, listening for drones or blocking out the sound of explosions, unable to recall what true rest feels like… Their strength has carried them this far, but the toll of constant fear and trauma is becoming impossible to ignore. We witness this in the consequences of psychological distress and many cases of gender-based violence, which are often underreported.”

About the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine
In the weeks after the conflict began in February 2022, the humanitarian crisis exceeded the worst predictions.

largely women
and children.

What do Ukrainian refugees need most?
The most urgent needs for Ukrainian refugees and displaced people are clean water, hygiene, shelter, and protection from violence, including violence against women and girls.
More people need financial help to rent homes, fix property, or pay for medical care. Besides the conflict, displaced families face
cold weather
, power cuts, and limited healthcare
—
especially women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.

Hope amid war: The human face of Ukraine's crisis
Seeking refuge
1 million
refugees have fled Ukraine for Poland, the largest number registered in any European country.
For 10 years, Olena moved within Ukraine to escape conflict. The 2022 invasion led her to finally cross into Poland.
Starting fresh in Poland with CARE's support
Olena, a trained healthcare specialist, found her Ukrainian diploma was not recognized in Poland. Determined to continue her profession, she enrolled in a Polish medical university to pursue a full bachelor’s degree – a journey will take several years.
CARE covered her first year of study and offered language classes, financial help, and advice.
After fleeing war in Ukraine, Olena is now a refugee in Poland, where she works as a nurse.
"CARE's support has been life-changing. It helps you feel that you matter."
– Olena
Standing with refugees
CARE Poland is currently the only organization providing cash assistance to new refugees entering Poland, making stories like Olena’s possible. Similar programs run by other NGOs have been closed, mostly due to lack of funding.
Other types of aid that CARE Poland provides include:
Psychosocial support
Food and water
Health services
Support for accommodation and employment
How to help Ukraine: What CARE is doing
CARE has launched an appeal to help the most at-risk Ukrainians, especially women-led
families
and the elderly. We aim to
assist
4 million people
affected by the conflict.
CARE and
our
partners are responding in
U

and Moldova—to meet humanitarian needs.
We
provide shelter, mattresses, blankets, hygiene supplies, healthcare, mental health support, and protection, focusing especially on women, girls, and the elderly. CARE supports displaced people in Ukraine and refugees and host communities in these countries.
CARE is responding in Ukraine and neighboring countries by providing hygiene supplies, blankets, and more.
After fleeing Kyiv the day the war started, Daria became a teacher with CARE's cash-for-work program for Ukrainian refugees and later joined the CARE staff in Poland.
