Is Putin strong, or a paper bear?

Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky
said

Whether this is true or not, President Donald Trump would do well to recall a
certain top-level meeting in 1973
hundreds of years earlier
“‘Paper tiger,'” Secretary of State Henry Kissinger responded. “Yes, that was all about us,” prompting laughter as he noted Mao’s love of describing the supposed hollowness of the U.S. economy in these terms—and he likely had a point in the 1970s.
“But you are a German from Germany,” Mao responded. “But your Germany now has met with an ill fate, because in two wars it has been defeated,” a statement with which Kissinger agreed.
Germany had attempted “too much, beyond its abilities and resources,” Kissinger said, adding that the Germans “were not prepared for a long war.” Mao lit his cigar as Kissinger talked.
What we have here is similar to what Kissinger described, a Russia that has attempted too much and spread itself too thin, unprepared for what has become a long war. And, to paraphrase Mao’s description, it has a “paper bear” economy.
The context
While another round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks concluded last week with little progress, the conference did produce more rumors about potential economic dealmaking between the U.S. and Russia—some at the expense of Ukraine—to reach a ceasefire in the war now entering its fifth year.
It would not be the first time President Trump dangled misleading economic incentives in an attempt to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the conflict. During their brief August meeting in Alaska, reports swirled about plans by the Trump administration to propose the return of Western companies to Russia and to pursue industrial partnerships as motivation for Putin. Widespread backlash from the general public to corporate boardrooms quickly emerged at the prospect of economic cooperation with the Putin regime and the potential of subjecting businesses to the significant risks from operating in an autocratic Russia.
That action, along with the ensuing discussions between the Russian and U.S. negotiators, prompted us to examine the extent to which the Russian economy continues to offer value to Western companies. The answer: very little.
Russia is not remotely a major superpower. With 80% of Russia’s territory sparsely populated, indeed essentially uninhabitable, due to its extreme cold, permafrost, and poor soil, especially in Siberia and the Far East, over 80% of the population lives in the European-facing 20% of its massive land mass. Its commodity-based economy of raw materials brings zero value added to the world economy and now most of those resources are found elsewhere more safely and even more cheaply. The economy does chug along for now by economic cannibalism, eating its future investment in productive industries and infrastructure. It is essentially the equivalent of throwing the living room furniture into the furnace to keep the heat ablaze, temporarily.

That is in addition to the hundreds of billions of dollars that abandoned the Russian economy in 2022 after our team helped catalyze the exit of over 1,000 major corporations following the invasion. Their departure was not just a statement of support for Ukrainian independence and condemnation of Putin’s unprovoked aggression. It was a firm declaration that the value the Russian market represents to multinational corporations under Putin’s authoritarian rule is inconsequential.
In fact, companies that curtailed operations

India, too, has extracted similar discounts on expanded oil imports. Other countries, such as Turkey, the UAE, Kazakhstan, and Armenia, have become
key hubs
With that leverage in mind, Trump, ever the dealmaker, will have an opportunity to exploit these fractures during his coming state visit with Xi. But the economic pressure points extend far beyond China. A critical look at Russia’s domestic economy reveals an edifice that is crumbling from within, one that should fundamentally reshape how Washington approaches the negotiating table.
The Illusion of Russian Economic Resilience
The structural rot now visible across Russia’s economy confirms what over 1,000 corporations concluded in 2022. Under Putin, the Russian market is not merely undervalued; it is a rapidly depreciating asset. Economic data since the western firms’ departure validates that the exodus was not an overreaction but an early recognition of a decline that has only accelerated.

Against this fiscal backdrop, the $12 trillion in rumored economic agreements begins to look less like a negotiating framework and more like fiction, one that presupposes a functioning, investable economy rather than burning through its liquid reserves to keep the war machine running.
Energy revenues continue to plunge under the expanding sanctions regime. State oil and gas revenues

The human costs are no less staggering. Over 800,000 Russians—80% with higher education, mostly between the ages of 20 and 40—have fled the country, while more than 700,000 have been sent to the front lines,

Putin has strategically approached his war as one of attrition, betting that Ukraine’s will and the West’s support will falter before he is forced to concede. Recent battlefield gains in Kupyansk have undercut Moscow’s narrative that defeat is inevitable, and the E.U. and even the U.S., to some degree, have maintained their monetary and military support, albeit precariously. Sustaining the front lines will always be critical for both sides, but allied support gives Ukraine an economic advantage that should be better understood and exploited.
The bottom line is far more dire than the Kremlin portrays. Russia’s remaining Western assets are negligible, its most important trading partner is hedging its bets, and its domestic economy is consuming itself to sustain a war it cannot afford. Putin’s leverage at the negotiating table rests almost entirely on bluster and the willingness of others to believe it. Trump has an opportunity to negotiate from a position of genuine strength, but only if his team recognizes that the economic hand Russia is playing is far weaker than the one it is advertising. The data leave little room for doubt—time is not on Moscow’s side.
This paper bear doesn’t have a mighty roar within it.

Notes on estimating the value of foreign assets in Russia:
The Chief Executive Leadership Institute’s comprehensive analysis was informed by
four years of research
into the decisions of more than 1,500 public and private companies to operate in Russia. The list of companies is divided into five categories, graded on a school-style letter-grade scale of A-F based on the completeness of withdrawal. Of the more than 1,500 companies in total, over 500 companies graded C (“Scaling Back”), D (“Buying Time”), and F (“Digging In”) were considered in our analysis; nearly 400 of those are located in North America and Europe and considered “Western companies.”
The asset values of Russian operations were identified by obtaining the Tax Identification Number (TIN) for each Russian subsidiary, from which we sourced the financial statements of those subsidiaries as reported to the Russian Federation. Of the approximately 400 Western corporations, the TINs of nearly 300 companies were discovered and verified. To arrive at the most conservative figure, we extrapolated the value of the assets held by the remaining 100 companies for which no TIN could be found, based on industry and letter grade.
While accounting for the asset values of every Western company with ongoing operations in Russia is impossible under a corrupt regime, our tracker is comprehensive and evaluates the actions of the vast majority of large- and medium-sized multinational corporations.
