Trump hints at friendly Cuba takeover amid crisis
Saturday, 28 February 2026, 00:34
As reported by the online media
Ukrinform
U.S. President Donald Trump has floated the possibility of a ‘friendly takeover’ of Cuba, which is currently facing a deep economic crisis.
According to an eyewitness near the White House, the remark was made during a conversation with reporters.
“They have no money. They have nothing right now. Perhaps we could resort to a friendly takeover of Cuba,” he said, without clarifying what exactly he meant.
According to the president, many Cuban immigrants in the United States would like to return to their homeland and are supporting pressure on the Cuban authorities.
“They have no money. They have nothing right now. Perhaps we could resort to a friendly takeover of Cuba.”
–  Donald Trump
“This could be very positive for people who have been expelled from Cuba, or even worse, for those who live here.” he said. “We have people here who want to return to Cuba. They are very pleased with what’s happening.”

Timeline of Events and the Context of the Crisis
According to independent sources, on Wednesday a vessel under the U.S. flag entered Cuban territorial waters, where a clash with local border guards occurred; four people on board died. Cuba is currently experiencing a serious crisis, intensified by economic sanctions and a blockade of oil supplies, creating significant difficulties for the regime.
In summary, Trump’s remarks continue to be discussed in the context of future scenarios for Cuba–U.S. relations against the backdrop of the current economic pressure.
Useful reading:
On June 30, 2025, US President Donald Trump signed a national security memorandum to strengthen sanctions against Cuba, reinstating stricter policies and travel bans to curb economic benefits to the Cuban military and support human rights.
Cuba faces a severe economic crisis marked by fuel shortages, halted tourism, and social hardships, threatening the livelihoods of many, including classic car tour operators in Havana.
