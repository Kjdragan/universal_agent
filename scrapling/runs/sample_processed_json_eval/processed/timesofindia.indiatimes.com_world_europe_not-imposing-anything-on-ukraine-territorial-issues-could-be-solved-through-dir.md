KYIV: Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told a gathering of the Yalta European Strategy here that resolving territorial issues in the Russia-Ukraine war could be left to a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin. Joining online from Washington and touting a possible future trilateral between the leaders of US, Ukraine and Russia, Witkoff asserted that Washington wasn’t imposing anything on Ukraine.
