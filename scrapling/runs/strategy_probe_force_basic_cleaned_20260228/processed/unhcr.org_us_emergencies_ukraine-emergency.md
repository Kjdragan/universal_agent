12.7 million people inside Ukraine required humanitarian assistance

Global Appeal:
2026
Donors – governments, business, and private individuals – have been incredibly generous over the past year. This must be sustained if we are to provide people with the support they urgently need today and for the coming year. I hope all our donors will continue to enable the response to these humanitarian needs.
Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees
What is UNHCR doing to help?
UNHCR is responding by leading the Protection and Shelter/NFI Clusters in Ukraine, providing urgent protection and assistance to evacuees and war-affected people, and supporting early recovery and durable solutions for IDPs and returnees.
We are scaling up cash assistance for winter needs, shelter repairs, and energy support, and has launched a social facilitator programme to connect vulnerable displaced and returned people with social services.
Regionally, UNHCR coordinates the 2025–2026 Regional Refugee Response Plan with 200 partners across ten countries, focusing on life-saving protection, socio-economic inclusion, and strengthening national systems.
In Romania, priorities include legal aid, child protection, and employment access; in Bulgaria, socio-economic inclusion through community hubs; in Poland, strategic investment in refugees’ human capital through legal status, social protection, and employment pathways; and in the Republic of Moldova, transition to national systems and localization.
