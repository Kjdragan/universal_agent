About the War in Ukraine
The full-scale war in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022 following the Russian Federation’s invasion of the country. As a result of heavy shelling and fighting, 3.7 million people have been driven from their homes and are internally displaced and 5.9 million people have crossed into neighboring countries in the region including Poland, Hungary, Moldova or other countries globally. Poland has welcomed the greatest number of Ukrainian refugees and currently hosts approximately 1 million refugees.
Missile and rocket attacks have caused widespread death, destruction of homes and businesses and severely damaged energy infrastructures across Ukraine. The energy crisis is disrupting public access to water, electricity, heating, healthcare, education and social protection. More than 2.5 million homes across the country – 13 percent of the housing stock – have been damaged or destroyed, leaving many Ukrainians in damaged homes or in buildings ill-prepared for life-threatening freezing temperatures. As the war continues, humanitarian needs are multiplying and spreading. An estimated 10.8 million people in Ukraine will need humanitarian assistance in 2026, with the hardest winter yet for Ukrainians.
Particularly vulnerable groups include older people and people with disabilities who may be unable to flee from high-risk areas. Women and children, who make up approximately 76 percent of refugees fleeing the crisis, are at risk of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation and abuse.
Since the start of the war, UNHCR has delivered over 410,000 emergency shelter kits and materials in the immediate aftermath of attacks, provided psychosocial support to around 300,000 affected people, and repaired more than 37,000 war-damaged homes.
“The destruction I have witnessed is immense, and the personal stories of loss and hardship are heart-wrenching. Despite this, Ukrainians continue to show extraordinary courage, compassion and hope. Their strength should compel all of us to action – to protect lives now, to support them in the vital rebuilding that is already underway, and to work tirelessly for a just and lasting peace,” the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Barham Salih said in a
