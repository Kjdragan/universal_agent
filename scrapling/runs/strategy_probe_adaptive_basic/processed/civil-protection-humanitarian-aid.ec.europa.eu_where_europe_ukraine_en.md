Introduction
Russia’s war on Ukraine continues to escalate in 2026 and shows no signs of abating:
with 2,514 civilians killed, 2025 has been the deadliest year of the conflict since 2022.
Millions of people have limited or no access to basic services. Heavy fighting and attacks continue to endanger the lives of civilians and cause severe damage to housing, water. electricity supply, heating, and public infrastructure such as schools and health facilities.
The EU has mobilised all available resources to enable the delivery of emergency assistance to Ukraine.

What are the needs?
Overview
In February 2022, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered the fastest-growing displacement crisis in the world. Millions of people were forced to leave Ukraine, while millions more were displaced within the country.
The majority of those fleeing Ukraine were women and children.
Currently, about
3.3 million

Needs inside the country
The situation is most severe along the frontlines in eastern, northeastern and southern Ukraine, and in the Russian-occupied territories.
Russia’s war on Ukraine has led to serious humanitarian challenges. Ensuring safe access for humanitarian organisations is essential to deliver relief items and enable safe evacuations from areas under attack.
Sustained hostilities along the frontline and relentless aerial attacks on urban areas continue to cause harm and suffering to civilians, triggering displacement towards safer areas. Extensive damage to housing leaves thousands of individuals with inadequate accommodation, particularly those in collective centres and closer to the frontline.
Repeated Russian attacks on infrastructures are leaving millions of Ukrainians without essential services, such as water, electricity, and heating, causing severe hardship in this harshest ever winter season.
The war continuously increases protection concerns, as civilians are exposed to shelling, armed violence, mines, family separation, or eviction. The safety risks for women and girls are extremely worrying, as is the situation of the most vulnerable groups (children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and LGBTIQ+ people). At least 2.5 million people, primarily women and girls, require prevention and response services to gender-based violence.
Continuous attacks also give rise to mental health care needs. Nearly 10 million people are at risk of or are living with mental health conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The situation for children is especially worrying due to their exposure to conflict and violence, restricted access to safe education and limited opportunities for social interaction.
The repeated violations of
international humanitarian law
How are we helping?
The EU’s largest civil protection operation to date
To provide emergency assistance to Ukrainians, the European Commission is coordinating its largest ever operation under the
EU Civil Protection Mechanism
So far, all 27 EU countries together with 6 participating states (Norway, Türkiye, North Macedonia, Iceland, Serbia and Moldova), have offered in-kind assistance ranging from medical supplies to shelter items, vehicles and energy equipment.
The EU has established logistical hubs in Poland, Romania, and Slovakia to channel items to Ukraine more efficiently. As of February 2026,
more than 157,000 tonnes of aid
Given the immense need for emergency equipment in Ukraine, the EU has deployed assistance from its
rescEU
power generators
medical supplies
temporary shelter units
water treatment stations in response to the Kakhovka dam breach
specialised equipment for public health risks such as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats
© European Union, 2024
By the end of 2025, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism successfully
relocated a full thermal power plant from Lithuania to Ukraine
The EU has also
delivered 7,200 transformers and around 10,000 generators
To date, the EU support for Ukraine's energy sector has helped meet the needs of an estimated 9 million people.
The EU is also coordinating medical evacuations of Ukrainian patients in urgent need of treatment, transferring them to hospitals across Europe to receive specialized care. In September 2022, the EU opened a hub in Rzeszów, Poland, to facilitate these medical evacuations.
The EU Medevac Hub offers treatment to patients arriving from Ukraine before they are flown out to a hospital in another European country. So far,
more than 4,900 patients
In April 2023, Ukraine joined the
EU Civil Protection Mechanism
EU humanitarian aid in Ukraine
The EU has been delivering humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since February 2014.
Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the European Commission has allocated over €1.4 billion for humanitarian aid programmes in Ukraine. This includes:
€485 million in 2022
€300 million in 2023
€165 million in 2024
€220 million in 2025
€220 million in 2026
EU humanitarian funding is helping people inside Ukraine by providing them with:
cash assistance to help cover basic needs
protection
health care
including mental health and psychosocial support
emergency and winterised shelter
food and water
essential household items
education in emergencies
Recently, in light of the growing energy crisis, EU humanitarian partners contributed to the establishment and operation of ‘invincibility points’ particularly across Kyiv, to provide for a much-needed lifeline.
Our partners are present across the country and mobilising assistance on the ground to assist the most vulnerable.
EU humanitarian offices in Ukraine play a key role in facilitating humanitarian coordination and information sharing among various organisations, including donors, authorities and humanitarian partners. Thanks to field presence in Kyiv and Dnipro, EU humanitarian experts are also carrying out missions in almost all affected regions of Ukraine to assess the needs and monitor EU-funded actions.
