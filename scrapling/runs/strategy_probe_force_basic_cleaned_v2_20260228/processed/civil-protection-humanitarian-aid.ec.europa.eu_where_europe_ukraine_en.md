Russia’s war on Ukraine continues to escalate in 2026 and shows no signs of abating:
with 2,514 civilians killed, 2025 has been the deadliest year of the conflict since 2022.
Millions of people have limited or no access to basic services. Heavy fighting and attacks continue to endanger the lives of civilians and cause severe damage to housing, water. electricity supply, heating, and public infrastructure such as schools and health facilities.
The EU has mobilised all available resources to enable the delivery of emergency assistance to Ukraine.

The situation is most severe along the frontlines in eastern, northeastern and southern Ukraine, and in the Russian-occupied territories.
Russia’s war on Ukraine has led to serious humanitarian challenges. Ensuring safe access for humanitarian organisations is essential to deliver relief items and enable safe evacuations from areas under attack.
Sustained hostilities along the frontline and relentless aerial attacks on urban areas continue to cause harm and suffering to civilians, triggering displacement towards safer areas. Extensive damage to housing leaves thousands of individuals with inadequate accommodation, particularly those in collective centres and closer to the frontline.
Repeated Russian attacks on infrastructures are leaving millions of Ukrainians without essential services, such as water, electricity, and heating, causing severe hardship in this harshest ever winter season.
The war continuously increases protection concerns, as civilians are exposed to shelling, armed violence, mines, family separation, or eviction. The safety risks for women and girls are extremely worrying, as is the situation of the most vulnerable groups (children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and LGBTIQ+ people). At least 2.5 million people, primarily women and girls, require prevention and response services to gender-based violence.
Continuous attacks also give rise to mental health care needs. Nearly 10 million people are at risk of or are living with mental health conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The situation for children is especially worrying due to their exposure to conflict and violence, restricted access to safe education and limited opportunities for social interaction.
