## User capabilities
#### Quality and performance enhancements to Copilot Chat
Copilot Chat is evolving, and the new **Copilot Chat quality roadmap** showcases the latest enhancements and new features that make user experiences smoother and more dependable. Each month this new roadmap will highlight a selection of features that are available to users who have a qualifying Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license, at no extra cost. For the latest information on what's new, check out the Copilot Chat Quality Roadmap.

With the new **session persistence enhancement** for Copilot Chat, users can seamlessly continue conversations even after navigating away from a session, meaning they never lose progress and can easily pick up right where they left off. After submitting a prompt, Copilot instantly creates an entry in the navigation pane’s session history, preserving the conversation. This means users can leave the current session and return later to find everything just as they left it. This update also boosts reliability and continuity, making navigation smoother and ensuring workflows remain uninterrupted. This feature rolled out in October.
**Improving response accuracy for file-based questions** gives users more dependable and precise answers, even in complicated situations with several files or vague queries like “Create a FAQ.” With this upgrade, Copilot can accurately grasp what users intend, even if a question doesn’t use exact keywords or pulls information from multiple documents. By analyzing and combining data across files and interpreting broad or unclear requests, Copilot helps users get the answers they need without having to restate or fine-tune their questions. This feature is rolling out in November.
**Agent recommendations** in Copilot Chat helps users quickly find agents that best match their needs, making problem-solving faster and more efficient. When a question fits an agent’s specialty, Copilot highlights it as a clear suggestion in the chat. As users interact, Copilot analyzes the input and, if there’s a match, displays a recommended agent. Just click the prompt to access the agent and get targeted help, saving time and effort. This feature rolled out in October.

#### New model, calendar search, and Bing web cards in Copilot Chat
**GPT-5 will soon become the default model in Copilot Chat** , letting users take advantage of the latest model from OpenAI. Powered by GPT-5's real-time router, Copilot dynamically selects the right model for each prompt using a high throughput chat model for quick responses and a deeper reasoning model for complex, multi-step tasks. If Copilot selects the reasoning model, users can bypass it and use the chat model for more direct responses. Initially, the toggle will be on by default, and then eventually removed. This update is rolling out in November and will roll out later to users without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.

Copilot Chat is simplifying calendar management.
  * Users can soon **search their calendar based on meeting organizers**. When asking Copilot to find meetings scheduled by a manager, teammate, or peer, users receive a list from the calendar. This streamlines the process of managing, reviewing, and preparing for upcoming meetings. This feature is rolling out in November.
  * **Delegates who currently have access to other users' calendars can use Copilot Chat to search those calendars**. This enhancement streamlines meeting detail retrieval and facilitates efficient management of another individual's schedule within Copilot Chat. This feature is rolling out in November.
  * Users can now ask Copilot to **search their Outlook calendar for meetings by category** , and it displays all tagged meetings with key details like title, date, time, and location to help organize schedules efficiently. This feature rolled out in October.

**Bing web cards** are launching soon in Copilot Chat to help quickly visualize information from the web. They deliver rich, fast information in expandable cards when users search for common information like weather, stocks, sports, news, and more. Users will see Bing web cards when using Copilot Chat to search the web. The cards are available for users both with and without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. This feature is rolling out in November.

The **Copilot Chat API** lets users securely integrate Microsoft 365 Copilot into their AI solutions without data egress or compromising compliance. Instead of managing vector indexes and orchestration, users can now simply send prompts to the API for synthesized answers based on web and work data. These APIs enable multi-turn conversations using enterprise and web search grounding, enhancing custom agents with Copilot capabilities. This feature rolled out in October.

#### Previews in mobile and search enhancements for Microsoft 365 Copilot app
**AI Views in Microsoft 365 Copilot Search** deliver more detailed, context-aware summaries by including relevant metadata, related resources, and suggested actions, helping users quickly determine the relevance of a result without opening the underlying file or message. AI Views now work across a wider range of Microsoft 365 apps and major third-party platforms through Copilot connectors, making it valuable for diverse enterprise scenarios. This feature is rolling out in November.
Microsoft 365 Copilot Search will soon deliver **more accurate, context-aware, and actionable responses to natural language queries by using semantic search** , organizational context, and deep integration with Microsoft 365 data. The new improvements not only provide direct answers but also surface related resources, suggested actions, and links to deeper content. This helps users seamlessly move from finding information to taking action. This feature is rolling out in November.
Microsoft 365 Copilot Search now **returns people information for broad people-related queries** , so users can easily discover and explore both known and new contacts. Whether a user is searching for someone with a specific skill like “project management leadership” or looking for “developers in London,” Copilot Search helps them find and connect with the right people. This feature rolled out in October.
When opening a Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file in the Microsoft 365 Copilot mobile app, users can now use Copilot Chat to **ask questions about the files directly in the preview**. This streamlines the mobile experience, so users can easily get quick insights from their files: for example, viewing a summary of a long Word document, extracting deadlines from a PowerPoint deck, or analyzing data in an Excel spreadsheet. This feature rolled out in October.

#### Audio recap and new file summaries for Copilot in Teams
Staying informed shouldn’t mean being glued to a screen. That’s why we’re introducing **audio recap** , a new way to catch up on meetings. With audio recap, a meeting recap is transformed into an audio experience that users can listen to on the go. Whether commuting, walking between meetings, or at their desk, users have a hands-free way to stay connected and informed. Users can generate an audio recap for up to eight meetings at a time, and choose the delivery style that best fits how they want to listen:
  * Newscast—one AI speaker delivering a fast, concise summary.
  * Executive—two AI speakers offering an efficient summary with minimal commentary.
  * Casual—two AI speakers providing a summary with extra color and commentary.

Audio recaps are easily accessible from the meeting recap page, ready to replay anytime. And with availability on both desktop and mobile, users can catch up wherever work takes them. This feature is rolling out in November.
When a file is shared in a chat, users don’t always have the time to open it, read it, and grasp the key ideas. With **new file summaries in 1:1 and group chats** in Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot can quickly summarize content from Microsoft Word documents, so users can understand the main points without opening the file. This feature is also available on mobile, so users can easily grasp key ideas without reading an entire document on a small screen while on the move. It respects the file's security policies, ensuring that only users with access to the file receive a summary, which will carry the same sensitivity label as the original file. This feature rolled out in October.
#### Speaker notes and translation for Copilot in PowerPoint
Copilot in PowerPoint now offers an **on-canvas experience for creating speaker notes** , replacing the previous chat-based workflow. Users can generate notes for an individual slide or an entire presentation, to more easily prepare without breaking their flow. This feature rolled out in October on web, Windows desktop, and Mac.
!Have Copilot create speaker notes for one slide or the entire presentation with a new on button.
Need to share a presentation in another language? Copilot now provides an **on-canvas experience for translating slides** , streamlining localization in just a few clicks. This update replaces the previous chat-based approach, so users can translate content quickly without leaving their deck. This feature rolled out in October on web, Windows desktop, and Mac.
!Copilot can translate your presentation for you with a new option in the on slide Copilot menu.
#### Agent Mode in Word
Creating Word documents is now easier than ever. With **Agent Mode in Word** , document creation becomes an interactive, conversational experience. Instead of starting from a blank page, users can simply tell Copilot what they need, such as _“summarize recent customer feedback highlight key trends.”_ Copilot handles the heavy lifting by drafting content, suggesting refinements, and asking clarifying questions along the way. It keeps the process flowing, so writing feels more like a dialogue than a task. Users focus on their ideas, and Copilot brings them to life with Word’s native styles and polished formatting. This deeper interaction means faster iteration, better ideas, and a more engaging writing experience. Agent Mode in Word is available through the Frontier program in October and is rolling out in November.
#### Agent Mode in Excel
**Agent Mode in Excel** plans, executes, and validates multi-step tasks—like building models, reshaping tables, and creating charts—directly in the grid. Users stay in control with transparent steps and editable outputs, making complex workflows faster and more intuitive. Agent Mode in Excel rolled out in October through the Frontier program, now available directly in Copilot in Excel for Web through the Tools menu, and will be rolling out to desktop in the future.

#### Meeting planning improvements for Copilot in Outlook
Meetings are more successful with robust agendas, but drafting those agendas can be tedious and time-consuming. Copilot can help: when a user creates a meeting invite, Copilot can **draft an agenda** based on the meeting title, attendees, and the user’s input. Because Copilot is grounded in Microsoft 365 work data, it can suggest agenda topics relevant to a user’s meetings, chats, and emails. Once Copilot has drafted an initial agenda, users can make edits, or give feedback to Copilot to further revise before sending the meeting invite. This feature rolled out to Outlook for Windows, Outlook for web and Teams in October.

Preparing for meetings can be time and effort intensive. New enhancements to Copilot’s meeting preparation experience help streamline the process. Directly within the Outlook meeting event form, Copilot can now **proactively generate key insights to help users prepare for specific meetings**. Copilot also suggests additional ways it can help, from finding the pre-reads to learning more about the meeting's intended outcome. Users can then continue the conversation via chat and get answers to additional questions that are top-of-mind. In addition, Copilot now supports all meeting types – including 1:1 meetings – via the meeting preparation experience. These feature enhancements rolled out in October.

#### New agents and updates to Researcher
The Employee Self-Service Agent provides a centralized experience for employee support, starting with HR and IT, helping employees quickly find answers and complete tasks like checking leave balances or submitting IT tickets. It integrates with existing systems and can hand off inline and with context to Workday or ServiceNow agents, so users don't have to switch between tools. Built in Copilot Studio for HR and IT scenarios, this custom agent has connectors and preconfigured workflows for existing systems such as Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors, while also being customizable and fully extensible to fit organizational needs. The agent streamlines employee experiences, improves resolution times, and supports Microsoft 365 security and compliance, with future support for Facilities and other verticals. This agent is rolling out in November.

**Surveys Agent** removes the hassle of using multiple tools to create forms, chase down answers, and interpret feedback. Surveys Agent is a pre-built agent that brings the entire survey creation process together in one conversational experience. This personal survey expert is ready to help with every scenario, from gathering feedback from a training session, to measuring employee satisfaction or running customer research. This agent rolled out in October.

**App Builder agent** lets users quickly create lightweight, interactive apps—like project trackers, feedback forms, or dashboards—using natural language and their existing Microsoft 365 data. These apps are secure, enterprise-ready, and instantly deployable, storing data in Microsoft Lists for easy collaboration without external setup. Sharing is simple and safe, with permissions inherited from Microsoft 365, so teams can work together seamlessly in a familiar environment. App Builder is available through the Frontier program and rolled out in October.

**Workflows agent** helps users automate repetitive tasks across Microsoft 365 apps like Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, and Planner using simple prompts. Built directly into the Copilot agent, it enables users to create, test, and monitor automations—such as meeting summaries or task digests—with enterprise-grade security and compliance. Deep integration with Microsoft 365 helps ensure access to Graph data and seamless actions across services, with future upgrades available through Copilot Studio for advanced customization. Workflows is available through the Frontier program and rolled out in October.
Researcheris built to tackle complex, multi-step research at work using advanced deep reasoning models. Now users can better customize their research reports and tailor them to their needs. Using **source controls** , users can select data sources such as their work data—including their meetings, emails, chats, and SharePoint files—by simply adjusting the toggles to generate context-aware reports.

And to stay right in the flow of work, users can easily **switch to Researcher directly from Copilot Chat within the prompt box**. These features rolled out in October.
## Copilot Control System
#### Quickly find Copilot Control System features on Microsoft 365 Public Roadmap
Now IT admins can discover and track all features for the Copilot Control System on the Microsoft 365 Public Roadmap. Admins can **search using the term _copilotcontrolsystem_** to instantly access a comprehensive list of relevant features and updates. This quick search saves time and ensures that admins remain up to date with the latest advancements and changes. As a result, IT admins can make better informed decisions, plan deployments more effectively, and proactively manage the Copilot experience for their organization. This can lead to improved user productivity and administrative control over their Microsoft 365 environment. This update rolled out in September.
!: A query on Microsoft 365 Public Roadmap showing a list of features below.
#### New reports and management tools in Microsoft 365 admin center
Organizations can optimize license management, monitor adoption trends, and enhance secure deployment strategies thanks to new **tracking capabilities for Microsoft 365 Copilot in GCC moderate environments**. Admins receive access to comprehensive usage reports that detail total and daily active users, prompt submissions, and app interactions across Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OneNote, Loop, Teams, Outlook, and the M365 Copilot app, along with user-level insights for effective oversight.

Admins can track prompt activity to optimize Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption and license utilization. The new **Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report** provides detailed metrics on total prompt submissions at both the organizational and individual user level. With access to daily trends, active day counts, and user-level submission rates, teams can monitor engagement, identify high-usage patterns, and make informed decisions about enablement and licensing strategies. This feature rolled out in October.
!A highlighted adoption screens chart shows usage intensity trends over time.
**Agent ownership reassignment** enables AI admins to transfer ownership of shared agents within the organization, ensuring seamless management when employees leave or change roles. Admins can reassign agents to users with active Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses, granting the new owner full edit and delete rights, as well as access to all associated files. The previous owner loses all access, which strengthens information protection and accountability. With this capability, organizations benefit from improved continuity and streamlined handling of agent ownership. This feature rolled out in October.

Earlier this year, Copilot Control System introduced the ability to export agent inventory to a CSV file, giving AI admins a convenient way to efficiently capture, audit, and analyze their agent population. The **CSV export now includes key metadata** such as app ID, creator, sensitivity level, agent capabilities, knowledge sources, supported actions, and more. This enhanced visibility streamlines compliance reviews, supports security assessments, and simplifies reporting for governance teams. AI admins can access this export feature via the Microsoft 365 admin center > Copilot > Agents > Export to Excel. This feature rolled out in October.
Model Context Protocol gives agent makers a standard framework to expose tools and APIs as callable actions to integrate in more flexible and dynamic ways with a wide range of services. Now, **Copilot Control System management controls in the Microsoft 365 admin center support MCP-powered agents** along with all other agents in the organization using the same familiar controls. AI admins gain visibility into agent activity, can enable or block them, configure access, and audit usage to ensure compliance. Dynamic MCP agents surface real-time metadata and updates, while state agents follow established deployment methods. With ongoing investment in unified agent management, Copilot Control System empowers admins to maintain trust, security, and compliance by providing a comprehensive, single-pane view of all agents across their organization. This feature rolled out in October.
Copilot Control System now enables AI admins to **apply****prepaid Copilot credit capacity****to SharePoint agents and Copilot Tuning pay-as-you-go services**. Copilot credit capacity packs give organizations the option to pre-purchase 25,000 credits per month, providing a predictable and cost-efficient option for Copilot usage. Starting this month, global admins can apply available credits to SharePoint agents and Copilot Tuning, extending Copilot credits to these services. Once all Copilot credit capacity has been used, these services switch to pay-as-you-go. This feature rolled out in October.
Microsoft 365 companion apps—People, Files, and Calendar—enable users to find what’s important and take action, right from the taskbar. The apps surface the right content in real time and keep work moving with Copilot: summarizing team updates, flagging comments that need input, and recapping missed meetings. To make this experience consistent across the organization, admins can centrally **pin Microsoft 365 Copilot apps, including Microsoft 365 companion apps, to the Windows taskbar** for all users, ensuring everyone has immediate access to the apps they rely on most. This admin control can help organizations drive adoption, improve efficiency, and create a standardized experience across devices, so they can maximize the value of their Microsoft 365 and Copilot investments. This feature rolled out in October. 
!A Microsoft 365 admin center window showing the settings section with an option to Pin Microsoft 365 Copilot apps to the Windows Taskbar.
#### Team views in Copilot Dashboard
Team leaders can now access the Copilot Dashboard and advanced reports with **results for their teams only**. Viva Insights admins can control this feature through the manager settings, where they can either adjust the minimum group size threshold, AAD, or use a CSV upload. This scoped access ensures leaders see the right data with the right guardrails, enhancing visibility, security, and decision-making. In addition, delegation support empowers managers to share their insights with others in their organization. If a manager already has delegates assigned, those delegates will automatically gain access to these enhanced capabilities in the web app. This feature rolled out in October.
!A settings page within the Copilot Dashboard shows how managers can add delegates to personal insights.

#### Quality and performance enhancements to Copilot Chat
\n
Copilot Chat is evolving, and the new **Copilot Chat quality roadmap** showcases the latest enhancements and new features that make user experiences smoother and more dependable. Each month this new roadmap will highlight a selection of features that are available to users who have a qualifying Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license, at no extra cost. For the latest information on what's new, check out the Copilot Chat Quality Roadmap.
\n!\\"A\n\n
With the new **session persistence enhancement** for Copilot Chat, users can seamlessly continue conversations even after navigating away from a session, meaning they never lose progress and can easily pick up right where they left off. After submitting a prompt, Copilot instantly creates an entry in the navigation pane’s session history, preserving the conversation. This means users can leave the current session and return later to find everything just as they left it. This update also boosts reliability and continuity, making navigation smoother and ensuring workflows remain uninterrupted. This feature rolled out in October.
\n\n
**Improving response accuracy for file-based questions** gives users more dependable and precise answers, even in complicated situations with several files or vague queries like “Create a FAQ.” With this upgrade, Copilot can accurately grasp what users intend, even if a question doesn’t use exact keywords or pulls information from multiple documents. By analyzing and combining data across files and interpreting broad or unclear requests, Copilot helps users get the answers they need without having to restate or fine-tune their questions.

Deep integration with Microsoft 365 helps ensure access to Graph data and seamless actions across services, with future upgrades available through Copilot Studio for advanced customization. Workflows is available through the Frontier program and rolled out in October.
\n\n
Researcheris built to tackle complex, multi-step research at work using advanced deep reasoning models. Now users can better customize their research reports and tailor them to their needs. Using **source controls** , users can select data sources such as their work data—including their meetings, emails, chats, and SharePoint files—by simply adjusting the toggles to generate context-aware reports.
\n\n\n
They can also **customize the Researcher report length** by choosing between a short summary or a detailed report for deep dives into specific topics, and then export the report into a Word document to easily share insights with team members.
\n\n\n
And to stay right in the flow of work, users can easily **switch to Researcher directly from Copilot Chat within the prompt box**. These features rolled out in October.

## Copilot Control System
\n
#### Quickly find Copilot Control System features on Microsoft 365 Public Roadmap
\n
Now IT admins can discover and track all features for the Copilot Control System on the Microsoft 365 Public Roadmap. Admins can **search using the term _copilotcontrolsystem_** to instantly access a comprehensive list of relevant features and updates. This quick search saves time and ensures that admins remain up to date with the latest advancements and changes. As a result, IT admins can make better informed decisions, plan deployments more effectively, and proactively manage the Copilot experience for their organization. This can lead to improved user productivity and administrative control over their Microsoft 365 environment. This update rolled out in September.
\n\n\n
#### New reports and management tools in Microsoft 365 admin center
\n
Organizations can optimize license management, monitor adoption trends, and enhance secure deployment strategies thanks to new **tracking capabilities for Microsoft 365 Copilot in GCC moderate environments**. Admins receive access to comprehensive usage reports that detail total and daily active users, prompt submissions, and app interactions across Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OneNote, Loop, Teams, Outlook, and the M365 Copilot app, along with user-level insights for effective oversight. This feature rolled out in October.
\n\n\n
Admins can track prompt activity to optimize Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption and license utilization. The new **Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report** provides detailed metrics on total prompt submissions at both the organizational and individual user level. With access to daily trends, active day counts, and user-level submission rates, teams can monitor engagement, identify high-usage patterns, and make informed decisions about enablement and licensing strategies. This feature rolled out in October.
\n\n\n
**Agent ownership reassignment** enables AI admins to transfer ownership of shared agents within the organization, ensuring seamless management when employees leave or change roles. Admins can reassign agents to users with active Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses, granting the new owner full edit and delete rights, as well as access to all associated files. The previous owner loses all access, which strengthens information protection and accountability. With this capability, organizations benefit from improved continuity and streamlined handling of agent ownership. This feature rolled out in October.
\n\n\n
Earlier this year, Copilot Control System introduced the ability to export agent inventory to a CSV file, giving AI admins a convenient way to efficiently capture, audit, and analyze their agent population. The **CSV export now includes key metadata** such as app ID, creator, sensitivity level, agent capabilities, knowledge sources, supported actions, and more. This enhanced visibility streamlines compliance reviews, supports security assessments, and simplifies reporting for governance teams. AI admins can access this export feature via the Microsoft 365 admin center > Copilot > Agents > Export to Excel. This feature rolled out in October.
\n\n
Model Context Protocol gives agent makers a standard framework to expose tools and APIs as callable actions to integrate in more flexible and dynamic ways with a wide range of services. Now, **Copilot Control System management controls in the Microsoft 365 admin center support MCP-powered agents** along with all other agents in the organization using the same familiar controls. AI admins gain visibility into agent activity, can enable or block them, configure access, and audit usage to ensure compliance. Dynamic MCP agents surface real-time metadata and updates, while state agents follow established deployment methods. With ongoing investment in unified agent management, Copilot Control System empowers admins to maintain trust, security, and compliance by providing a comprehensive, single-pane view of all agents across their organization. This feature rolled out in October.
\n\n
Copilot Control System now enables AI admins to **apply****prepaid Copilot credit capacity****to SharePoint agents and Copilot Tuning pay-as-you-go services**. Copilot credit capacity packs give organizations the option to pre-purchase 25,000 credits per month, providing a predictable and cost-efficient option for Copilot usage. Starting this month, global admins can apply available credits to SharePoint agents and Copilot Tuning, extending Copilot credits to these services. Once all Copilot credit capacity has been used, these services switch to pay-as-you-go. This feature rolled out in October.
\n\n
Microsoft 365 companion apps—People, Files, and Calendar—enable users to find what’s important and take action, right from the taskbar. The apps surface the right content in real time and keep work moving with Copilot: summarizing team updates, flagging comments that need input, and recapping missed meetings. To make this experience consistent across the organization, admins can centrally **pin Microsoft 365 Copilot apps, including Microsoft 365 companion apps, to the Windows taskbar** for all users, ensuring everyone has immediate access to the apps they rely on most. This admin control can help organizations drive adoption, improve efficiency, and create a standardized experience across devices, so they can maximize the value of their Microsoft 365 and Copilot investments. This feature rolled out in October. 
\n\n\n
#### Team views in Copilot Dashboard
\n
Team leaders can now access the Copilot Dashboard and advanced reports with **results for their teams only**. Viva Insights admins can control this feature through the manager settings, where they can either adjust the minimum group size threshold, AAD, or use a CSV upload. This scoped access ensures leaders see the right data with the right guardrails, enhancing visibility, security, and decision-making. In addition, delegation support empowers managers to share their insights with others in their organization. If a manager already has delegates assigned, those delegates will automatically gain access to these enhanced capabilities in the web app. This feature rolled out in October.
