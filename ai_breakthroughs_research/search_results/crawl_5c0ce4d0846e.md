Today, we’re announcing Gemini 2.0 — our most capable AI model yet, designed for the agentic era. Gemini 2.0 has new capabilities, like multimodal output with native image generation and audio output, and native use of tools including Google Search and Maps.
We’re releasing an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance. Developers can start building with this model in the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And Gemini and Gemini Advanced users globally can try out a chat optimized version of Gemini 2.0 by selecting it in the model dropdown on desktop.
We’re also using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra, which explores the future capabilities of a universal AI assistant; Project Mariner, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as an experimental extension; and Jules, an experimental AI-powered code agent. We continue to prioritize safety and responsibility with these projects, which is why we’re taking an exploratory and gradual approach to development, including working with trusted testers.
This week, we started testing Gemini 2.0 in AI Overviews in Search, and early next year, we’ll expand Gemini 2.0 to more Google products.
