# GPT-4o vs. Claude 3.5 vs. Gemini 2.0 – Which LLM to Use and When
 
 Abhishek Shukla  Last Updated : 12 Feb, 2025 
5 min read 
In the dynamic field of **large language models** (LLMs), choosing the right model for your specific task can often be daunting. With new models constantly emerging – each promising to outperform the last – it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Don’t worry, we are here to help you. This blog dives into three of the most prominent models: **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5**, and **Gemini 2.0**, breaking down their unique strengths and ideal use cases. Whether you’re looking for creativity, precision, or versatility, understanding what sets these models apart will help you choose the right LLM with confidence. So let’s begin with the GPT-4o vs Claude 3.5 vs Gemini 2.0 showdown!
Metric GPT-4o vs Gemini 2.0 vs Claude 3.5 Accuracy Gave accurate calculations with the best explanations.Provided accurate statistical calculations and good explanations.Provided accurate results, but its explanations were the least detailed. Depth of ExplanationExplained the steps and reasoning behind them clearly and thoroughly.While the explanations were clear, they didn’t go into much depth.Didn’t provide as much insight into the steps taken to arrive at the answer
## Overview of the Models
**GPT-4o:** Developed by OpenAI, this model is renowned for its versatility in creative writing, language translation, and real-time conversational applications. With a high processing speed of approximately 109 tokens per second, GPT-4o is perfect for scenarios that require quick responses and engaging dialogue.
**Gemini 2.0:** This model from Google is designed for multimodal tasks, capable of processing text, images, audio, and code. Its integration with Google’s ecosystem enhances its utility for real-time information retrieval and research assistance.
**Claude 3.5:** Created by Anthropic, Claude is known for its strong reasoning capabilities and proficiency in coding tasks. It operates at a slightly slower pace (around 23 tokens per second) but compensates with greater accuracy and a larger context window of 200,000 tokens, making it ideal for complex data analysis and multi-step workflows.

## GPT-4o vs Claude 3.5 vs Gemini 2.0: Performance Comparison
In this section, we will explore the various capabilities of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 2.0 LLMs. We will test out the same prompts on each of these models and compare their responses. The aim is to evaluate them and find out which model performs better at specific types of tasks. We will be testing their skills in:
  1. Coding
  2. Reasoning
  3. Image Generation
  4. Statistics

### Task 1: Coding Skills
**Prompt:** _“Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. Please include comments explaining each step.”_
**Output** :
#### Comparative Analysis
**Metric**| **GPT-4o**| **Gemini 2.0**| **Claude 3.5**  
---|---|---|---  
Clarity of Explanation| Provides clear, step-by-step explanations about the process behind the code.| Delivers brief explanations focusing on the core logic without much explanation.| Offers concise explanations but sometimes lacks the depth of context.  
Code Readability| Code tends to be well-structured with clear comments, making it more readable and easier to follow for users of all experience levels.| Code is typically efficient but may sometimes lack sufficient comments or explanations, making it slightly harder to understand for beginners.| Also delivers readable code, though it may not always include as many comments or follow conventions as clearly as ChatGPT.  
Flexibility| Very flexible in adapting to different coding environments and problem variations, easily explaining or modifying code to suit different needs.| While highly capable, it might require more specific prompts to make changes, but once the problem is understood, it delivers precise solutions.| Adapts well to changes but might require more context to adjust solutions to new requirements.  
### Task 2: Logical Reasoning
**Prompt:** _“A farmer has chickens and cows on his farm. If he counts a total of 30 heads and 100 legs, how many chickens and cows does he have? Please show your reasoning step by step.”_
**Output** :
#### Comparative Analysis
**Metric**| **GPT-4o**| **Gemini 2.0**| **Claude 3.5**  
---|---|---|---  
Detail in Reasoning| Gave the most detailed reasoning, explaining the thought process step-by-step.| Provided clear, logical, and concise reasoning.| Gave a reasonable explanation that was more straightforward.  
Level of Explanation| Broke down complex concepts clearly for easy understanding.| Medium level of explanation.| Lacked depth in explanation.  
### Task 3: Image Generation
**Prompt:** _“Generate a visually appealing image of a futuristic cityscape at sunset. The city should feature tall, sleek skyscrapers with neon lighting, flying cars in the sky, and a river reflecting the colorful lights of the buildings. Include a mix of green spaces like rooftop gardens and parks integrated into the urban environment, showing harmony between technology and nature. The sky should have hues of orange, pink, and purple, blending seamlessly. Make sure the details like reflections, lighting, and shadows are realistic and immersive.”_
**Output** :

#### Comparative Analysis
**Metric**| **GPT-4o**| **Gemini 2.0**| **Claude 3.5**  
---|---|---|---  
Output Quality| Performed reasonably well; delivered good results.| Produced detailed, contextually accurate, and visually appealing results; captured nuances effectively.| No significant strengths were highlighted. The model created an SVG file instead of image  
Accuracy| Required more adjustments to align with expectations; lacked the refinement of Gemini’s output.| None noted.| Results often misaligned with descriptions; and lacked creativity and accuracy compared to others.  
Performance| Moderate performance; room for improvement.| Best performance; highly refined output.| Least effective in generating images.  
### Task 4: Statistical Skills
**Prompt:**_“Given the following data set: [12, 15, 20, 22, 25], calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation. Explain how you arrived at each result.”_
**Output:**
#### Comparative Analysis
**Metric**| **GPT-4o**| **Gemini 2.0**| **Claude 3.5**  
---|---|---|---  
Accuracy| Gave accurate calculations with the best explanations.| Provided accurate statistical calculations and good explanations.| Provided accurate results, but its explanations were the least detailed.   
Depth of Explanation| Explained the steps and reasoning behind them clearly and thoroughly.| While the explanations were clear, they didn’t go into much depth.| Didn’t provide as much insight into the steps taken to arrive at the answer
