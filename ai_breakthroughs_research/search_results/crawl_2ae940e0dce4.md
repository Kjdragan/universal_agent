Try a premade Gem made by Labs like ‘Recipe Genie’ that helps transform your leftovers into delicious meals or ‘Claymation Expert’ that turns any topic into a claymation infographic. Remix to make it your own or start from scratch to bring your ideas to life.
  * **Why:** We want to make Gems even more helpful to meet your custom needs.

## 2025.12.04

Gemini connects to your favorite apps, so you can stay productive on your drive. Find info buried in your email, easily find answers about businesses, restaurants and attractions around you, edit, translate, and send messages with ease, and create custom soundtracks for any occasion on the fly.
To get started, make sure you are using the Gemini app on your Android phone, and you'll see a tooltip on your car display once it's available for you. Then to use it, just say “Hey Google,” press the mic button on your car screen, or long press the voice control button on your steering wheel. Learn more about how to get the most out of Gemini in your car.
  * **Why:** We want to make your time on the road as valuable as possible without compromising safety.

### Gemini 3, our most intelligent model yet, is available to everyone in the app
  * **What:** Gemini 3 Pro is rolling out to everyone in the Gemini app starting today, with higher limits for users in the Google AI Plus, Pro & Ultra plans. It brings state-of-the-art reasoning to your most complex problems, and is our best vibe coding model yet. It can also reason across text, images, audio and video better than ever before. So whether you're uploading a video of you playing a sport to get advice on how to improve your form, or transcribing notes from a lecture you missed, the Gemini app can help without missing a beat.
Starting from your first use you’ll also notice responses are more helpful, better formatted and more concise.
Try Gemini 3 Pro by selecting “Thinking” in the model drop down.
  * **Why:** We want to make Gemini the most helpful AI assistant for everyone. With the advanced reasoning of Gemini 3 Pro, you can now tackle your most ambitious projects with greater confidence and efficiency.

### Introducing visual layout and dynamic view in Gemini Labs
  * **What:** We're introducing two new experimental Labs features in the Gemini app: visual layout and dynamic view. Powered by Gemini 3 and new advances from Google Research, these features make your responses more engaging and interactive.
Visual layout uses multimodal capabilities to move beyond text, generating a visually immersive response with photos and interactive modules. These elements solicit your feedback and help you further customize Gemini’s response across multiple turns. Try asking Gemini to “plan a 3-day trip to Rome next summer,” and you’ll get a visual itinerary you can actually explore and customize based on what interests you.
Dynamic view takes this a step further using agentic coding capabilities. Gemini will design and code a unique experience with a user interface that’s perfect for your specific prompt. For example, ask Gemini to “explain the Van Gogh Gallery with life context for each piece,” and you'll get a stunning, interactive response that lets you tap, scroll, and learn. Or, try uploading a photo of you and ask for fashion advice.
We’re rolling out these Labs features to different subsets of users. Some users can expect to see visual layout or dynamic view in the tool menu of the Gemini app soon.
  * **Why:** We believe that the best way to answer a question isn't always a text-based response. By creating dynamic, interactive interfaces on the fly, we can help you explore information in a way that is more intuitive and tailored to your specific needs. Your feedback on these experiments helps us shape the future of generative UI.

### Gemini Agent is now available on the web, to Google AI Ultra subscribers 18+ in the US.
  * **What:** Gemini Agent is a new experimental tool that can complete multi-step tasks from start to finish, while keeping you in control.
Agent uses Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning and tool calling to break up complex tasks into smaller steps. If your task requires it, it will use apps like Gmail or Calendar, alongside many of the tools in Gemini, like deep research capabilities and Canvas, to achieve your end goal. Additionally, it can use live web browsing capabilities to research and take action on the web as part of completing your task.
Gemini Agent is designed to get your confirmation before taking any critical actions, like sending an email or making a purchase, and you can always pause or take over at any time.
  * **Why:** We want to make Gemini the most helpful AI assistant for everyone. This is a first step towards building a true generalist agent that can navigate the complexities of your daily tasks from start to finish, while still keeping you in control.

## 2025.09.25
### Update to 2.5 Flash in Gemini
  * **What:** An enhanced version of Gemini 2.5 Flash is now available to Gemini app users. Responses are now better organized with improved formatting. Gemini 2.5 Flash uses elements like headers, lists, and tables to make even complex outputs clearer and easier to understand. We’ve also improved image understanding, so Gemini can better interpret and respond to your uploads.
To feel the difference, try working through a problem at school or work involving an image, like a diagram, and having Gemini walk you through it; or upload your class notes and ask Gemini to organize, summarize or create flashcards for you.
  * **Why:** We’re committed to continually improve performance and making Gemini a more insightful, collaborative partner. When it’s better at understanding context and images, it’s easier for you to create, interact, and accomplish your goals.

  * **What:** Starting today, you can share the Gems you create with friends, family, and colleagues. Gems are a simple way to customize Gemini to achieve your specific goals. This means you can tackle recurring tasks without retyping lengthy prompts and providing context each time.
Share your weekly meal planner Gem to help a friend get inspiration, or send your vacation planner Gem to a family member before their big trip. To share, simply open your Gem manager on the web and click “Share” next to any Gem you’ve created. Sharing Gems works just like sharing files in Google Drive, giving you control over who can view or edit your Gem. Visit the Help Center to learn more about sharing Gems.
  * **Why:** Turn your favorite Gems into a shared resource so you can help others also save time on repetitive prompting and get started more easily. Rather than creating from scratch, you can use a fine-tuned Gem with effective instructions with friends or even an entire organization.

## 2025.08.26
### Reimagine your photos with a prompt
  * **What:** Experience a new level of creativity with our latest image generation and editing model. We've improved how Gemini follows your instructions, making it easier to get the results you want.
