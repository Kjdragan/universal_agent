## What are the world’s most pressing problems?
The problem you work on is probably the largest factor in how big a difference you can make.
It helps to focus on issues that are large in scale, tractable, and unduly neglected by the rest of society.
Some of these issues may even threaten humanity’s future — making them especially high priority.
Here’s our (uncertain!) ranking of global problems where additional people can have the most impact:

Most pressing problems:
 Power-seeking AI systems  Power-seeking AI systems   Extreme power concentration  Extreme power concentration   Engineered pandemics  Engineered pandemics   Great power conflict  Great power conflict   Factory farming  Factory farming 
###  Power-seeking AI systems
We may develop very powerful AI systems before we've built adequate control mechanisms. If such systems accumulate power while misaligned with human values, the result could be catastrophic.
 Read more 
###  Extreme power concentration
AI could turbocharge people's efforts to seize and hold power. Surveillance, persuasion, and control technologies could let small groups or authoritarian leaders entrench their rule — potentially with little chance of recovery.
 Read more 
###  Engineered pandemics
Pandemics are among the deadliest events in human history. Developments in biotechnology and AI may lower barriers for creating devastating biological weapons, and make future pandemics even worse.
 Read more 
###  Great power conflict
Beyond killing billions in worst-case scenarios, great power rivalry accelerates dangerous arms races that could spiral out of control.

###  Factory farming
There are trillions of farmed animals, and the vast majority are on factory farms. The conditions in these farms are far worse than most people realise.

## High-impact careers in the age of AGI
There’s a real possibility that artificial general intelligence — AI systems that are as good or better than humans at most tasks — will be developed by 2030.
This would cause enormous change and pose extreme risks. So, if you want to have a high-impact career, we think you should urgently consider working on making things go well.
Many people, with both technical and non-technical backgrounds, are needed.
See why we think this, and what you can do to help:

> !Neel Nanda
> After earning his maths degree at Cambridge, Neel saw finance and further study as his main options. He'd long been concerned about AI risks, but wasn't sure how to help. A call with our 1-1 team helped him see AI safety research as a viable option. We connected him to key researchers and helped him secure an internship at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, followed by internships at DeepMind and UC Berkeley. These experiences set him on a path to becoming a leading AI safety technical researcher. Neel has since published influential work on mechanistic interpretability and is now a researcher at DeepMind, working to make advanced AI systems more transparent.

### Who is this for?
Because we aim to help people use their careers to tackle large-scale issues, particularly around AI, our advice is mostly aimed at people who might want to do that. However, much of our content can be useful for everyone. We advise people aged 18–45 (mostly), with a variety of skill profiles. We talk to people from around the world, but due to limited capacity, our services mostly cover careers in the US and UK.
Our audience 
### How is this free?
We're an independent nonprofit funded by individual donors and philanthropic foundations. They donate to us so that we can help people have a greater positive impact on the world. Everything we provide is free, and we don't accept any corporate sponsorships or advertising fees.

We do that by providing in-depth research and resources on top problems and how you can use your career to address them.
What we offer:
  * Our online research, which includes:
    * Our career guide, covering our core advice
    * Our profiles of pressing world problems
    * Our reviews of high-impact career paths
    * Our articles on valuable skills
    * And many other articles and publications
  * Our podcast — in-depth interviews about the world’s most pressing problems, and how you can help solve them
  * Our job board — with current opportunities to work on big and neglected problems and build skills
  * Our one-on-one service — providing individualised career advice for our more engaged readers, helping them make concrete plans and important career connections, and matching some users to key high-impact roles

We recommend starting with our career guide, which will help you get ideas, form a plan, and put it into action.

Where should I start? This is a lot.
    
Start with our career guide.
Or if you want something even shorter, we wrote a two-minute summary with the key takeaways.
Keep in mind that you don’t need to read everything to make use of our advice! Just pick what you’re most interested in, and go from there.
Start here
What do you mean by ‘high-impact career’?
    
Roughly speaking, the positive impact of your career depends on how many people (or other ‘moral patients‘) you help, how much you help them, and how long the effects last.
If you’d like a more precise answer, see our full article on how to define doing good.
Learn more
Why should I listen to your career advice?
    
Lots of career advice isn’t based on much more than opinion and personal anecdotes. We try to do better by drawing on:
  * Our experience from career advising calls with over five thousand people
  * More than a decade of researching, interviewing experts, and writing about high-impact careers
  * The best available research and academic literature — including advice from relevant experts and professionals, such as hiring managers
  * Research on decision making

Ultimately, though, you _shouldn’t_ just take our word for it — we’re probably wrong in lots of ways, and have changed our views over time. That’s why we try to be transparent about our reasoning, so you can make up your own mind.
More on our research principles
Why do you focus on certain global problems?
    
Our list of pressing global problems sets out the problems where we think **our readers can have the biggest positive impact by working on them**.
We prioritise problems that are unusually large in scale, unduly neglected, and solvable — because that’s where additional people can generally have the most positive impact.
Right now, problems that could pose existential risks top our list, because they threaten not just those alive today but also humanity’s entire future, and they remain neglected relative to their scale.
In particular, we think that there’s a realistic possibility of transformative AI in the coming decades. We think addressing risks from this transformative technology may be the most pressing problem in the world.
Our ranking is a best guess and a constant work in progress, meaning it’s undoubtedly incomplete and mistaken in many ways. It also may not align with your worldview. So we encourage you to think through the question of which problems are most pressing for yourself too. Where you focus will also depend on your opportunities to contribute to each issue.
To learn why we listed a specific problem and how you can help tackle it, read the full profile for yourself.
Read more
Why do you talk about AI so much?
    
We’ve been talking about risks from advanced AI since 2014, and we’ve ranked it as the world’s most pressing problem since 2016.
In recent years, AI has made enormous progress and continues to advance, and we’re worried that society isn’t on track to tackle the risks.
We think advanced AI systems could:
  * Worsen great power conflict
  * Empower dangerous actors, like terrorists or dictators
  * Become power-seeking on their own and disempower humanity
  * Otherwise lead to significant harms

In short, the harms are potentially catastrophic and approaching quickly — and not enough is being done about them.
We’re not sure exactly how advanced AI will develop, but companies are racing fast to build it, and world governments and individuals can hardly keep up — so the window to influence its trajectory might be closing.
We think more people should probably be paying attention and trying to help influence the development of AI for the better while curtailing the worst risks.
Read more in our problem profile on risks from advanced artificial intelligence.

How is all of this free?
    
We’re a nonprofit, and our work is fully funded by donors, whom we list here.
Our goal is to make as much progress on the world’s most pressing problems as possible, and by making our advice free, we can reach more people.
We don’t take any corporate sponsorship or run ads in our content, which helps us avoid bias. We also never sell user data, and don’t have any hidden fees or charges.
Read more
Is this advice aimed at me?
    
That depends!
We think lots of our advice — such as our career guide — will be useful for anyone who is interested in doing more good with their career, or even just curious.
That said, our aim is to help people tackle the world’s biggest and most neglected problems. So, our advice is primarily aimed at people who have the good fortune to be able to focus on that, and who have the security to change paths.
Due to our limited capacity, some of our advice focuses on a narrow range of paths, which can be competitive and demanding.
If you’re not able to change your career right now, see our advice on how to have a big impact without changing your job, through advocacy, political engagement, and donations.
Many people are not in a position to prioritise social impact, let alone make it a central focus, and that’s fine — we also have many priorities in life besides impact. But if you do want to make a big difference, we hope we can help.
Read more
Should I apply to speak to you 1-1?
    
Yes!
Because we have limited capacity to speak to people, we aren’t able to have a call with everyone who applies. But **the application form only takes 10 minutes**! So it’s worth filling out for most people — and if we don’t speak to you this time, you can always apply again in six months.
We’re looking to speak with people who:
  * Make social impact one of their main career goals
  * Take an analytical approach to social impact and career choice
  * Are already somewhat familiar with the basic principles presented in our career guide
  * Are interested in working on our pressing problems, especially helping mitigate risks from AI or other pressing problems exacerbated by AI
  * Have the ability to excel in a challenging career

We speak to people at all stages of their career, and you don’t need to already know exactly what you want to work on, or have a preexisting career plan.
If that sounds like you, then you should definitely apply!
Apply now
What career should I choose? How should I decide?
    
That’s what our whole site is all about!
And yes, it’s not an easy question, but we’re here to help you answer it.
Start by reading our career guide (or this two-minute summary). It will guide you through the rest.
Alternatively, if you just want to browse possible high-impact career paths, you can check out our career reviews.
Start here
What’s your best piece of advice?
    
Build useful skills, and then use them to tackle pressing global problems.
This might sound obvious — but in practice, very few people do this.
Many efforts to do good are far less effective than they could be, because they aren’t focused on the problems where additional effort has the biggest impact. See more in our problem profiles.
