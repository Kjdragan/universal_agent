## Major FDA Approvals in 2025

### Lecanemab (Leqembi) - Maintenance Dosing Approval

**August 29, 2025**: The FDA approved weekly subcutaneous maintenance dosing of Leqembi® (lecanemab) for early Alzheimer's disease, following an earlier approval on January 27, 2025, for intravenous maintenance dosing every four weeks [1](https://www.alz.org/news/2025/fda-action-approving-leqembi-subcutaneous-maintenance-dosing), [2](https://www.eisai.com/news/2025/news202506.html).

**Key Features:**
- More convenient weekly subcutaneous injection option
- Once every four weeks IV maintenance dosing
- Continuous treatment required as disease progression does not stop after plaque clearance
- Ongoing treatment slows disease progression and prolongs therapy benefits

### Donanemab (Kisunla) - July 2024 Approval

On July 2, 2024, the FDA approved Kisunla (donanemab) for adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia stage [3](https://www.alzint.org/news-events/news/donanemab-update-new-alzheimers-disease-treatment-approved-by-the-fda).

## Latest Clinical Trial Results (December 2025)

### Comparative Efficacy: Lecanemab vs. Donanemab

2025 phase-3 data demonstrate that both lecanemab and donanemab significantly slowed cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients:

- **Cognitive Decline Reduction**: Approximately 27-35% reduction in progression
- **Lecanemab Advantages**: Lower ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) risk and mortality compared to donanemab
- **Sustained Benefits**: Lecanemab shows sustained benefit over four years
- **Donanemab Results**: 35% slowing of decline with four trial-related deaths reported as of December 2025 [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470211825000545), [5](https://www.neurologylive.com/view/indirect-comparison-study-lower-aria-ich-related-mortality-risk-lecanemab-over-donanemab), [6](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/lecanemab-preserves-memory-over-4-years-early-alzheimers-2025a1000ktw)

### TRAILBLAZER-ALZ-2 Trial Results

- Nearly 1,800 people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease participated
- Monthly infusions of donanemab vs. placebo over 18 months
- Primary outcome: Change from baseline in iADRS score at 76 weeks was −6.86 (donanemab) vs. −10.06 (placebo)
- Difference: 3.20 points (95% CI: 0.12 to 6.27; P=0.04) [7](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2100708)
- 4 participants died during the trial, with deaths thought to be related to the drug's side effects

## Emerging Treatments in Development

### NU-9: Pre-Symptomatic Treatment Breakthrough

**December 2025**: Northwestern University scientists reported that the experimental drug NU-9 halted early Alzheimer's-related protein toxicity and inflammation in mouse models, suggesting a breakthrough pre-symptomatic treatment approach [8](https://sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222080119.htm), [9](https://sciencealert.com/new-drug-stalls-alzheimers-development-in-breakthrough-trial).

**Significance:**
- Targets disease before memory loss begins
- Addresses protein toxicity and inflammation
- Potential for pre-symptomatic intervention

### Trontinemab (Roche)

**October 2025**: Potential new Alzheimer's drug by Roche, still in development with trials due to start in autumn 2025. Early data from smaller trials suggests this drug may clear Alzheimer's-related proteins quickly and effectively [10](https://alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/potential-alzheimers-treatment-trontinemab-hits-the-news-how-does-it-work-and-is-it-available).

### Semaglutide (GLP-1) Trials

December 2025: Alzheimer's trials are testing Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 drug semaglutide, despite failures in other indications. CTAD 2025 conference results showed semaglutide could slightly reduce levels of Alzheimer's-related proteins in spinal fluid [11](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/alzheimers-drug-hunt-learns-cancer-fights-multi-target-playbook-2025-12-12/), [12](https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/ctad-2025-six-highlights-from-the-latest-clinical-trials-in-alzheimers-disease).

**Rationale:**
- Multi-target approach learning from cancer treatments
- Potential neuroprotective effects
- Ongoing investigation for protein reduction

## Diagnostic and Prevention Advances

### Blood Test Breakthroughs

2025 has seen major advances in blood-based biomarkers for early detection:
- Blood tests are becoming more accurate and accessible
- Earlier diagnosis enables earlier intervention
- Less invasive than traditional CSF or PET scans

### Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) Prevention

**October 2025**: A study found that older adults who ate diets containing the highest amounts of riboflavin (vitamin B2) had a 49% lower risk of developing disabling dementia compared to those who ate the least [13](https://alzinfo.org/articles/prevention/this-b-vitamin-may-be-critical-for-dementia-prevention).

### Copper Toxicity Inhibition

**December 2025**: Scientists at the IPC PAS are targeting copper using an organic molecule that may help inhibit copper's toxicity in Alzheimer's disease, cracking the complex process [14](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1109149).

## Technology and Innovation

### Graphene Neural Implants

InBrain, one of the World Economic Forum's 2025 Technology Pioneers, has developed an ultra-thin graphene implant that can detect neural signals, potentially offering new diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities [15](https://weforum.org/stories/2025/06/recent-breakthroughs-fight-against-alzheimers-disease).

## Safety Considerations and Monitoring

### Enhanced MRI Monitoring

**August 28, 2025**: FDA recommends additional, earlier MRI monitoring for patients with Alzheimer's disease taking Leqembi (lecanemab) due to ARIA risks [19](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-recommend-additional-earlier-mri-monitoring-patients-alzheimers-disease-taking-leqembi-lecanemab).

### ARIA Risk Comparison

- Lecanemab: Significantly lower risks of ARIA outcomes and related mortality
- Donanemab: Higher ARIA risk, especially in APOE4 carriers
- Careful patient selection and monitoring required
