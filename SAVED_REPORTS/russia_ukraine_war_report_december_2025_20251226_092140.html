            <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>The week of December 20-26, 2025, marked a critical juncture in the Russia-Ukraine war as diplomatic initiatives intensified amid continued heavy fighting. The United States and Ukraine reached consensus on a 20-point peace plan, though significant disagreements remain on territorial issues and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Russian forces continued their slow but steady territorial advances, claiming to have seized over 5,100 square kilometers in 2025, though independent verification suggests considerably smaller gains. Russian missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure escalated dramatically, while Ukraine expanded its long-range strike campaign against Russian oil infrastructure. Peace prospects remain uncertain, with both US Vice President JD Vance and Kremlin officials expressing skepticism about reaching agreement.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND DIPLOMATIC DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
            
            <h3>US-Ukraine 20-Point Peace Plan Emerges</h3>
            <p>Following marathon talks in Florida, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled a 20-point peace plan developed with the United States and European partners. According to NPR and Guardian reporting, the plan represents significant progress but leaves two critical issues unresolved: the status of Ukrainian-controlled portions of the Donetsk region and management of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Key provisions of the emerging agreement include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Freezing front lines in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts upon signing</li>
                    <li>NATO-level security guarantees for Ukraine (mutual defense clause)</li>
                    <li>Capping Ukraine's peacetime military at 800,000 personnel</li>
                    <li>No requirement for Ukraine to recognize occupied territories as de facto Russian</li>
                    <li>$800 billion in reconstruction funding mobilization</li>
                    <li>Accelerated free trade agreement with the United States</li>
                    <li>Security guarantees to be detailed in a separate bilateral US-Ukraine document</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Remaining Points of Contention</h3>
            <p>The most difficult issue remains the future of the Donbas region. Russia demands Ukraine relinquish all remaining Ukrainian-controlled territory in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts—an ultimatum Ukraine has rejected. The United States has proposed transforming these areas into free economic zones, while Ukraine insists any arrangement must be ratified by referendum and include international peacekeeping forces.</p>

            <p>Regarding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility currently under Russian occupation, the US proposes a consortium with Ukraine and Russia (33% each), with America as the main manager. Zelensky counter-proposed a US-Ukraine joint venture where Washington determines how to distribute its 50% share. These discussions alone required 15 hours of negotiations.</p>

            <h3>US Officials Express Cautious Pessimism</h3>
            <p>Contrasting with more optimistic administration statements, Vice President JD Vance offered a stark assessment, stating he lacks "confidence" there will be a peaceful resolution. "I think there's a good chance we will, I think there's a good chance we won't," Vance told Politico, calling the territorial concessions under discussion "terrible."</p>

            <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio struck a similar note, telling reporters: "It's not our war. It's a war on another continent. We can't force Ukraine to make a deal. We can't force Russia to make a deal. They have to want to make a deal."</p>

            <h3>Kremlin Response and Russian Rejection of Ceasefire</h3>
            <p>Russia rejected a US-proposed Christmas ceasefire, with Ukrainian officials noting Moscow launched holiday strikes instead. Russian Presidential Aide Yuriy Ushakov stated that Ukrainian and European amendments to the US proposal were "rather unconstructive" and would not improve prospects for peace.</p>

            <p>According to Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analysis, the Kremlin's demands remain incompatible with both the original 28-point plan and the revised 20-point proposal. Putin continues to insist on Ukraine's complete withdrawal from all of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts; abandonment of NATO aspirations; demilitarization; "denazification" (replacement of Ukraine's government); international recognition of Russia's annexations; and lifting of all Western sanctions.</p>

            <h3>European Financial Support</h3>
            <p>The European Council approved a significant 90-billion-euro ($106 billion) loan to Ukraine over two years, providing at least 45 billion euros ($53 billion) annually. Notably, European nations refused to connect this loan to 210 billion euros in frozen Russian state assets, after Italy, Bulgaria, Malta, and Belgium vetoed using those funds as collateral.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>TERRITORIAL CHANGES AND FRONTLINE SITUATION</h2>

            <h3>Russian Claims Versus Reality</h3>
            <div class="key-stat">
                <p>Russia claims to have seized 6,300 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in 2025, while the Institute for the Study of War estimates the actual figure at approximately 4,984 square kilometers containing 196 settlements.</p>
            </div>

            <p>During his year-end news conference, President Putin claimed Russian forces had seized significant territory in eastern Donetsk and Vovchansk in northern Kharkiv region. He also asserted control of half of Lyman and Kostiantynivka in Donetsk, and Hulyaipole in southern Zaporizhia region. However, ISW could not confirm these claims through satellite and open-source evidence. In fact, the think tank estimated Russia possesses no more than 7.2% of Kupiansk in Kharkiv, while Ukraine's commander-in-chief said Ukrainian forces had pushed Russia out of 16 square kilometers of Pokrovsk.</p>

            <h3>Confirmed Territorial Changes</h3>
            <p>According to Russia Matters' analysis of ISW data for the period November 25-December 22, 2025, Russian forces gained 138 square miles of Ukrainian territory. In the six days from December 16-22 alone, Russia gained 51 square miles. Since January 1, 2025, Russia has averaged 176 square miles of territorial gains per month.</p>

            <p>Total Russian territorial control stands at approximately 116,057 square kilometers (44,810 square miles), constituting 19.2% of Ukrainian territory—including Crimea and areas seized prior to the 2022 full-scale invasion.</p>

            <h3>Key Frontline Developments</h3>
            <p><strong>Siversk:</strong> On December 23, the Ukrainian General Staff confirmed Ukrainian forces withdrew from Siversk to preserve lives and combat power. Russian forces had surrounded the town with significant personnel and equipment advantages.</p>

            <p><strong>Kupyansk:</strong> Ukrainian forces are conducting counterattacks near and within Kupyansk, having cut off remnants of Russian groups in the town from logistics. Zelensky reported only 80-100 Russian servicemembers remain in Kupyansk, with Ukrainian forces conducting house-by-house clearing operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Pokrovsk:</strong> Ukrainian forces recently advanced in northwestern Pokrovsk. Russian forces control approximately 30% of nearby Myrnohrad, though Ukrainian forces maintain positions in parts of the town. Intense fighting continues with Russian drone operators creating significant difficulties for Ukrainian defenders.</p>

            <p><strong>Sumy Region:</strong> A renewed Russian push is attempting to break through in the Sumy region. Russian troops forcibly moved approximately 50 civilians from the border village of Grabovske to Russia. Ukrainian forces are battling to drive the occupiers back, with ongoing fighting in the village.</p>

            <h2>MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS AND CAMPAIGNS</h2>

            <h3>Russian Air and Missile Campaign Intensifies</h3>
            <p>December 22-23 witnessed one of Russia's largest combined missile and drone strikes of the war. According to Ukrainian Air Force reports, Russia launched 635 Shahed-type, Gerbera-type, and other strike drones (approximately 400 Shaheds), three Kinzhal ballistic missiles, and 35 Kh-101 and Iskander-K cruise missiles.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Ukrainian forces shot down 587 drones and 34 cruise missiles, but the strikes caused nearly full power outages in Rivne, Ternopil, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts, and milder outages in Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kharkiv oblasts. This was the ninth large-scale combined strike against Ukrainian energy infrastructure since the start of 2025.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Christmas Strikes Target Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, Russian forces continued targeting Ukrainian infrastructure, causing at least four civilian deaths. The strikes hit Odesa port facilities, a thermal power plant in Kharkiv (killing at least one person and injuring 13), and critical infrastructure in Chernihiv, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. Zaporizhstal metallurgical plant temporarily stopped production after losing power.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha noted that Russia launched the combined strikes after rejecting the US and German-proposed Christmas ceasefire.</p>

            <h3>Ukrainian Long-Range Strike Campaign Expands</h3>
            <p>Ukraine continued targeting Russian energy and military infrastructure, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Striking the Efremov Synthetic Rubber Plant in Tula Oblast (produces components for explosives and solid rocket fuel)</li>
                <li>Targeting a Russian Il-38N maritime patrol aircraft at Yeysk Airbase</li>
                <li>Hitting the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov region using Storm Shadow missiles</li>
                <li>Attacking oil storage facilities at Temryuk port in southern Russia</li>
                <li>Striking a gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region</li>
                <li>Hitting the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal in Krasnodar Krai, damaging the pipeline, two berths, two vessels, and causing a fire exceeding 1,000 square meters</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Since November, Ukraine has also expanded operations to target oil tankers supporting Russia's "shadow fleet," striking the Qendil in the Mediterranean Sea—the first time Ukraine has ranged tanker strikes that far from its shores.</p>

            <h3>Failed Russian Mechanized Assaults</h3>
            <p>Combat footage from December 22 revealed failed Russian mechanized assaults in the Dobropillya direction. Ukrainian forces destroyed six tanks, nine infantry fighting vehicles, five armored personnel carriers, one armored recovery vehicle, and 10 all-terrain vehicles during a reduced battalion-sized mechanized assault.</p>

            <p>ISW assessment notes that Russian forces have been unable to restore mechanized maneuver to the battlefield, with gains continuing at a "slow foot pace." The think tank states that "any sudden Russian operational-level breakthrough remains unlikely" given Ukrainian forces' ability to reliably defeat mechanized assaults at and above platoon level.</p>

            <h2>HUMANITARIAN IMPACT AND WAR CRIMES</h2>

            <h3>Civilian Casualties and Displacement</h3>
            <p>During the past week's intensified strikes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At least four civilians killed in strikes on December 22 and 24</li>
                <li>One child killed and five people injured in Zhytomyr Oblast</li>
                <li>At least one person killed in Odesa Oblast port and infrastructure strikes</li>
                <li>One person killed and 13 injured in Kharkiv thermal power plant strike</li>
                <li>Eight people wounded in Kherson and Sumy oblasts, including a 17-year-old girl and 20-year-old man</li>
                <li>Five people injured in Zaporizhzhia city drone strikes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Forced Deportations</h3>
            <p>Russian forces forcibly moved approximately 52 civilians from the border village of Grabovske in Sumy Oblast to Russia on December 20. Ukrainian officials reported these civilians did not evacuate despite Ukrainian warnings. This practice continues a documented pattern of forced deportations from occupied territories.</p>

            <h3>Energy Infrastructure Crisis</h3>
            <p>Ukraine's energy infrastructure continues to suffer from repeated Russian strikes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>64% of Ukraine's electricity generating capacity has been destroyed or occupied as of 2024</li>
                <li>Significant portions of thermal power generation have been destroyed</li>
                <li>Some hydropower installations damaged or destroyed</li>
                <li>Ukraine's energy infrastructure was operating at only about 50% of pre-invasion capacity as of Fall 2025</li>
                <li>ISW estimates Russia's strike campaign is splitting Ukraine's power grid east-west, with eastern regions "at the brink" of blackout and Kyiv also at risk</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT</h2>

            <h3>US Diplomatic Leadership</h3>
            <p>The Trump administration has taken an active role in peace negotiations, with special envoy Steve Witkoff leading talks in Miami. The administration has expressed both optimism about progress and realism about the challenges. The US has offered Ukraine NATO Article 5-like security guarantees, though the Kremlin has rejected Western troops within Ukraine as part of any peace deal.</p>

            <h3>European Support</h3>
            <p>European leaders have approved significant financial support for Ukraine, including the 90-billion-euro loan package. However, Europe remains divided on using frozen Russian assets as collateral. The EU has indicated it will make Ukraine a full member in the near future, which would entitle it to mutual defense from most EU members who are also NATO members.</p>

            <h3>Domestic Russian Sentiment</h3>
            <p>According to a state pollster, a majority of Russians expect the war in Ukraine to end in 2026. This assessment suggests the Kremlin may be testing public sentiment about potential peace scenarios, though official messaging continues to emphasize Russian determination to achieve its stated objectives.</p>

            <h2>ANALYSIS AND OUTLOOK</h2>

            <h3>Peace Prospects</h3>
            <p>Despite intensified diplomatic efforts, significant obstacles remain to reaching a peace agreement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Territorial Issues:</strong> Russia's demand for complete Ukrainian withdrawal from Donetsk and Luhansk remains unacceptable to Kyiv</li>
                <li><strng>Security Guarantees:</strong> Russia rejects Western troops in Ukraine; Ukraine demands robust security guarantees</li>
                <li><strong>Nuclear Facility:</strong> No agreement on Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant management</li>
                <li><strong>Sanctions Relief:</strong> Russia demands lifting of all Western sanctions</li>
                <li><strong>NATO Aspirations:</strong> Russia requires Ukraine abandon NATO membership goals permanently</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Atlantic Council analysis warns that Putin's imperial ambitions extend far beyond the four oblasts Russia currently claims. Putin has stated that achieving the liberation of "historical Russian lands" will occur "by any means necessary" if peace talks fail. The analysis notes that Putin considers "all of Ukraine" to be historically Russian and has indicated his vision includes the former Russian Empire and Soviet Union.</p>

            <h3>Military Trajectory</h3>
            <p>ISW assesses that Russian gains will likely continue at a slow foot pace, with sudden operational breakthroughs unlikely. The think tank notes that Russian forces have optimized for positional warfare and cannot conduct successful mechanized assaults at scale due to Ukrainian drone and artillery density.</p>

            <p>However, Russia continues to restructure and expand its conventional forces, having formed nine new maneuver divisions since 2022. ISW assesses this expansion is in line with Russia's preparation for possible future NATO-Russia war.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Implications</h3>
            <p>Small Wars Journal analysis outlines five potential war-termination models, ranging from "burnout" (mutual exhaustion) to "Finlandization" (territorial concessions in exchange for sovereignty). The analysis concludes that most endgames pose significant risks for Ukraine unless anchored in strong and enduring Western security guarantees.</p>

            <p>An American Enterprise Institute analysis cited in the report estimates a Russian victory would force the United States to spend an additional $808 billion over five years to reinforce NATO—nearly seven times the current $112 billion in US support for Ukraine.</p>
