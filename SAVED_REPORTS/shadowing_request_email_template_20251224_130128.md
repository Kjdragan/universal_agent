My name is Kevin Dragan, and I am a recent university graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences and a minor in Genetics.

Your background in genetics and the biomedical sciences provides an excellent foundation for genetic counseling. I am particularly interested in [choose one: prenatal genetics / cancer genetics / pediatric genetics / metabolic genetics] and would value learning about the daily work of genetic counselors at Baylor, given the program's outstanding reputation and its location within the Texas Medical Center.

I understand that exposure to genetic counseling through shadowing or informational interviews is recommended prior to applying to master's programs, and I am eager to gain firsthand experience to confirm my career choice and strengthen my future applications.

I have attached my resume for your review. I am flexible with scheduling and willing to complete any required institutional requirements (such as HIPAA training, background checks, or confidentiality agreements).

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of learning from your esteemed program.
