            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>The week of December 23-29, 2025, marked a critical period in the Russia-Ukraine war, characterized by intensifying diplomatic efforts alongside continued heavy fighting. The most significant development was President Donald Trump's mediation push, which saw substantial progress on a 20-point peace framework during his December 28 meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago. However, these diplomatic advances were immediately overshadowed by Russia's December 29 claim that Ukraine had attempted a drone strike on Vladimir Putin's presidential residence in Novgorod—a claim Ukraine vehemently denied as a fabrication designed to sabotage peace talks.</p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Key Developments:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>US and Ukraine reportedly agreed on 90% of a 20-point peace plan, including 15-year US security guarantees for Ukraine</li>
                    <li>Russia captured several settlements in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions while sustaining massive casualties</li>
                    <li>Russia launched its heaviest drone and missile attacks of the winter, targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure</li>
                    <li>EU approved a 90 billion euro loan package for Ukraine through 2027</li>
                    <li>Domestic attacks inside Russia increased, including explosions in Moscow and alleged assassination attempts on Russian officials</li>

            <h2>Peace Negotiations: The Trump-Brokered Framework</h2>
            <h3>The Mar-a-Lago Meeting (December 28)</h3>
            <p>The centerpiece of this week's diplomatic activity was the high-profile meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. According to multiple sources, the two leaders held discussions for over two hours, emerging with notably optimistic public statements about the state of peace negotiations.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <strong>90%</strong>
                <p>of the 20-point peace plan reportedly agreed upon between US and Ukrainian negotiators</p>
            </div>

            <p>Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Trump declared that Ukraine and Russia were "closer than ever before" to a peace settlement, though he acknowledged the possibility that negotiations could still collapse. "In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other," Trump said, adding that "it could also go poorly."</p>

            <p>Zelenskyy struck a similarly hopeful but cautious tone, telling reporters that the 20-point draft proposal was "about 90% ready." He confirmed that US-Ukraine security guarantees were "100% agreed" and that US-Europe-Ukraine security guarantees were "almost agreed," with the military dimension "100% agreed on" and a prosperity plan being finalized.</p>

            <h3>Security Guarantees Proposal</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the most concrete development to emerge from the negotiations was the US commitment to provide Ukraine with security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of any peace settlement. Zelenskyy revealed this detail in statements on December 29, though he noted he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter future Russian aggression.</p>

            <blockquote>"Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end." — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, December 29, 2025</blockquote>

            <p>Details of the security guarantees have not been fully disclosed, but Zelenskyy indicated they include provisions for how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the "presence" of partner forces. This aspect is particularly sensitive, as Russia has stated unequivocally that it will not accept the deployment of troops from NATO countries in Ukraine.</p>

            <h3>Outstanding Issues</h3>
            <p>Despite the reported progress, both leaders acknowledged that "one or two very thorny issues" remained unresolved. The primary sticking point continues to be territorial:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Donbas Question:</strong> Russia demands control over the entirety of the Donbas region (comprising the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk), including territory it does not currently hold</li>
                <li><strong>Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant:</strong> The status of Europe's largest nuclear facility, currently under Russian control, remains unresolved in the peace framework</li>
                <li><strong>Demilitarized Zones:</strong> Zelenskyy has indicated willingness to withdraw Ukrainian troops from parts of eastern Ukraine if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Trump himself acknowledged that one of the thorniest issues concerned "land already taken during the conflict." He suggested that if work continues "really well," the remaining issues could be resolved in "a few weeks."</p>

            <h3>Referendum Requirement</h3>
            <p>Zelenskyy has emphasized that any peace plan would need to be put to a referendum in Ukraine. However, this presents a significant logistical challenge: holding a national ballot would require a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness to agree to a truce without a full settlement.</p>

            <h2>The "Attack on Putin's Residence": Diplomatic Sabotage?</h2>
            <div class="alert-box">
                <strong>Breaking Development (December 29):</strong> Just hours after positive statements from the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that Ukraine had attempted to attack Vladimir Putin's presidential residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range drones.
            </div>

            <h3>Russian Allegations</h3>
            <p>According to Lavrov, the drone attack occurred overnight from December 28-29, "practically immediately after" the Trump-Zelenskyy talks in Florida. Lavrov stated that all 91 drones were destroyed by Russian air defenses and that there were no casualties or damage. More significantly, he announced that Moscow would be "revising" its negotiating position in the peace talks due to this alleged attack.</p>

            <p>Lavrov confirmed that "retaliatory" targets and attack timings had already been selected, though he did not specify what those targets might be. Importantly, he added that Russia "does not intend to withdraw from the negotiating process with the United States."</p>

            <h3>Ukrainian Denial and Accusations</h3>
            <p>President Zelenskyy immediately and categorically denied the Russian accusation, dismissing it as "another lie" and "a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia's own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war."</p>

            <p>In a statement to reporters, Zelenskyy warned his people to be on guard for fresh Russian strikes, saying Moscow was "simply preparing the ground to carry out strikes, probably on the capital and probably on government buildings."</p>

            <blockquote>"Everyone needs to be alert now, absolutely everyone. A strike on the capital may be carried out, especially since this person [Putin]... said they will choose corresponding targets." — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, December 29, 2025</blockquote>

            <p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha condemned what he called "Russian manipulations" aimed at creating "a pretext and false justification for Russia's further attacks against Ukraine, as well as to undermine and impede the peace process." He described it as a "usual Russian tactic: accuse the other side of what you are doing or planning yourself."</p>

            <h3>Trump's Response</h3>
            <p>When asked by reporters about the alleged attack, Trump said he was "very angry about it" and described it as "not good" and "not the right time" for such actions. "I don't like it," Trump said. "It's a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house."</p>

            <p>When pressed for evidence of the attack, Trump said, "We'll find out." According to Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov, Trump was "shocked, literally outraged" when Putin informed him about the alleged attack during a phone call on December 29.</p>

            <h3>Independent Verification</h3>
            <p>As of December 29, there was no independent evidence or visual confirmation of the alleged drone attack on Putin's residence in Novgorod. No images or footage had emerged, and Western officials had not commented on the claim beyond Trump's remarks. The lack of evidence, combined with the timing—coming immediately after positive developments in peace talks—has led many analysts to view the Russian accusation with skepticism.</p>

            <h2>Military Situation on the Ground</h2>
            <h3>Russian Advances</h3>
            <p>While diplomacy has dominated headlines, Russian forces have continued to make slow but steady territorial gains on the battlefield. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian forces captured approximately 6,460 square kilometers (2,494 square miles) of territory in Ukraine during 2025, including 334 villages.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <strong>14 sq km/day</strong>
                <p>Average rate of Russian advance in 2025</p>
            </div>

            <p>In late December, Russian commanders told President Putin during an inspection visit that Moscow's forces had captured the towns of Myrnohrad, Rodynske, and Artemivka in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, as well as Huliaipole and Stepnohirsk in the Zaporizhzhia region. However, Ukraine's military rejected Russia's assertions about Huliaipole and Myrnohrad, stating that "defensive operations" were ongoing in both areas.</p>

            <p>The ISW has estimated that at the current average rate of advance (14 square kilometers per day), it would take Russian forces until April 2029 to seize the rest of the four oblasts (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia) that Russia claimed to have annexed in 2022. This calculation does not account for major obstacles such as crossing the Dnipro River or capturing major cities like Zaporizhzhia city (pre-war population: 710,000) and Kherson city (pre-war population: 280,000).</p>

            <h3>Human Cost and Casualties</h3>
            <p>The human cost of the war continues to be staggering. According to the Centre for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), Russian military deaths have reached up to 250,000, with total casualties (killed and wounded) exceeding 950,000. By October 2025, Russia Matters cited UK Ministry of Defence estimates putting the number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded at 1,118,000.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian casualties, while lower, remain severe. President Zelenskyy confirmed in April that up to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, with approximately 340,000 wounded. In August, Trump claimed there had been more than 112,000 Russian deaths since January 2025 alone, compared with about 8,000 Ukrainian fatalities during the same period.</p>

            <h3>Energy Infrastructure Under Siege</h3>
            <p>Throughout December, Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy grid, reportedly pushing it "to the brink of collapse" according to The Telegraph. On December 27-29, Russian strikes caused extensive damage to energy infrastructure across multiple Ukrainian regions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Approximately 180,000 consumers were left without electricity across five Ukrainian regions (Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia, Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, and Sumy)</li>
                <li>In Odesa region, 280,000 households lost power, with 220,000 still waiting for restoration days later</li>
                <li>A sunflower oil spill caused by Russian bombardments contaminated the shoreline around Odesa, killing wildlife and forcing the temporary closure of the Pivdenny port</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest, continues to operate with only one external power line after the second was disconnected due to military activity. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned that reliable power is essential to continue cooling the plant's six reactors and spent fuel to avoid nuclear accidents.</p>

            <h2>Escalation Inside Russia</h2>
            <p>This week saw a notable increase in attacks inside Russian territory, signaling what appears to be a growing Ukrainian capability to strike deep behind the front lines.</p>

            <h3>Moscow Explosions</h3>
            <p>On December 25, an explosion in Moscow killed three people, including two police officers, just days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking Russian general in the same area of the capital. An official from Ukraine's military intelligence (GUR) told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of a Ukrainian operation and that the two police officers were targeted for taking part in Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

            <h3>Drone Attacks</h3>
            <p>Russian air defense units downed 16 Ukrainian drones en route to Moscow throughout December 25, according to Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin. The drones were repelled over a period of about 17 hours. Russia's Ministry of Defence said its aerial defense units destroyed 172 Ukrainian drones overnight on December 24-25, nearly half of them over regions bordering Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Ukraine confirmed that its drones had struck the Yefremov synthetic rubber plant in Russia's Tula region (south of Moscow) and a storage facility for marine drones in Russian-occupied Crimea.</p>

            <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
            <p>The attacks are beginning to affect Russia's economy. Kazakhstan's exports of its flagship CPC Blend of oil reached their lowest level in 14 months in December, as bad weather delayed efforts to repair Russian loading infrastructure after Ukrainian drone strikes on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal near Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiysk on November 29.</p>

            <h2>International Support and Sanctions</h2>
            <h3>European Union Financial Package</h3>
            <p>In a significant development, European Union leaders agreed on December 19 to provide Ukraine with an interest-free loan worth 90 billion euros ($105 billion) to meet its military and economic needs for 2026-2027. Importantly, the deal was structured by borrowing cash rather than tapping into frozen Russian assets held by the EU—a compromise reached after hours of difficult negotiations in Brussels.</p>

            <p>The decision was welcomed in Kyiv, with Ukrainian parliamentarian Danylo Hetmantsev telling CNN, "A financial disaster has been avoided. The decision is extremely important for Ukraine." Economist Serhiy Fursa noted that approximately 50 billion euros ($59 billion) would cover Ukraine's budgetary needs, leaving a surplus to purchase weapons and military equipment.</p>

            <h3>Individual Country Commitments</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Reparations Mechanism</h3>
            <p>In a separate but significant development, leaders from 34 European countries signed an agreement in The Hague on December 17 to create an International Claims Commission for Ukraine to seek compensation for hundreds of billions of dollars in damage from Russian attacks. "Every Russian war crime must have consequences for those who committed them," Zelenskyy said at the signing ceremony.</p>

            <h2>Analysis: Putin's Strategic Calculus</h2>
            <p>As peace negotiations progress, analysts are closely examining Vladimir Putin's strategic objectives and long-term intentions. A December 19 analysis from the Atlantic Council raises serious concerns about Putin's expansionist ambitions beyond Ukraine.</p>

            <h3>"Historical Lands" Rhetoric</h3>
            <p>In a December 17 address to Russian Defense Ministry officials, Putin declared that the maximalist goals of his Ukraine invasion would be met "unconditionally" and framed the war as a crusade to reverse Russia's post-Soviet retreat. "If the opposing side and their foreign patrons refuse to engage in substantive discussions, Russia will achieve the liberation of its historical lands by military means," he stated.</p>

            <h3>Concerns About Broader Ambitions</h3>
            <p>The Atlantic Council analysis warns that Putin's reference to "Novorossiya" (a Czarist-era term for large swathes of southern and eastern Ukraine) suggests his territorial ambitions may extend far beyond the partially occupied Ukrainian provinces currently claimed by the Kremlin. Putin has indicated his definition of Novorossiya encompasses approximately half of Ukraine, including the entire Black Sea coastline and major cities such as Odesa and Kharkiv.</p>

            <p>Perhaps most alarmingly, the analysis notes that Putin has repeatedly referenced the sacred status of Kyiv in Russian national mythology, making it "extremely difficult to imagine him accepting any peace proposal that secures Kyiv's postwar position as the capital of an independent Ukraine."</p>

            <blockquote>"I have said many times that I consider the Russian and Ukrainian peoples to be one people. In this sense, all of Ukraine is ours." — Vladimir Putin, St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Summer 2025</blockquote>

            <h3>Implications for European Security</h3>
            <p>The analysis warns that if Putin succeeds in establishing control over Ukraine, he would have at his disposal "the continent's two largest armies" (Russia's and a potentially integrated Ukrainian military). The author argues that "Europe alone is not yet in a position to defend itself against Russia" and that it would take years of rearmament to close this gap.</p>

            <p>Recent US intelligence assessments, according to Reuters, confirm that "Putin has not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and reclaiming parts of Europe that once belonged to the former Soviet Empire." The report notes that "the Europeans are convinced of it. The Poles are absolutely convinced of it. The Baltics think they're first."</p>

            <h3>The Fate of Putin's Regime</h3>
            <p>An analysis from 19FortyFive examines how the outcome of the Ukraine war will shape Putin's political future. The author argues that a settlement the Kremlin can plausibly cast as success might allow Putin to govern for years to come, but "if the result looks like defeat—plain enough that Russian elites and the public can see it—the once-unthinkable question of succession could return to Russian politics with real force."</p>

            <p>The analysis suggests that even a "victory" that consolidates Russia's current territorial control would leave Russia "a poorer, more militarized state" with "slow growth, persistent sanctions, and a defense-heavy budget crowding out civilian investment." In this scenario, Putin's legitimacy would rest "on not being seen to have lost rather than on restoring lost greatness."</p>

            <h2>Public Opinion and Humanitarian Impact</h2>
            <h3>Russian Public Expectations</h3>
            <p>According to Russia's state pollster VTsIOM, a majority of Russians expect the war in Ukraine to end in 2026. In the pollster's year-end presentation, VTsIOM Deputy Head Mikhail Mamonov said 70% of the 1,600 respondents saw 2026 as a more "successful" year for Russia than 2025, while for 55% that hope was linked to a possible end to Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>The Atlantic Council's analysis suggests this polling may indicate that "the Kremlin could be testing public reaction to a possible peace settlement as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict intensify."</p>

            <h3>Ukrainian Public Skepticism</h3>
            <p>On the snowy streets of Kyiv, Ukrainians expressed skepticism about the chances of peace. Sensei, a 65-year-old military veteran who was wounded during the battle for Bakhmut in 2022, told The Associated Press that almost nobody from his company is still alive. "But all these sacrifices, they are not in vain, because we need to prove... that we exist, that we are, that we have the right to our existence, to our territory, to our culture, to our language," he said.</p>

            <p>Denys Shpylovyi, a 20-year-old student, said Trump's willingness to accept Putin's arguments has put Zelenskyy in a difficult situation. "But I'm thankful for some progress. They are speaking, and maybe someday there will be hope," he added.</p>

            <h3>Humanitarian Consequences</h3>
            <p>The humanitarian impact of the war continues to be devastating:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Energy infrastructure damage has left hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians without electricity and heat during winter months</li>
                <li>Environmental damage includes the sunflower oil spill near Odesa, threatening marine ecosystems</li>
                <li>Mental health impacts are widespread as civilians endure constant drone and missile attacks</li>
                <li>The war has created millions of refugees and internally displaced persons</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Looking Ahead: Key Questions for January 2026</h2>
            <p>As we enter the new year, several critical questions will determine whether the current peace process leads to a ceasefire or further escalation:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Can the territorial dispute be resolved?</strong> Russia's demand for control over all of Donetsk and Luhansk—including territory it does not currently hold—remains the primary obstacle.</li>
                <li><strong>Will Russia accept European security guarantees?</strong> Putin has rejected any deployment of NATO troops in Ukraine, but European leaders are discussing a multinational force to monitor a potential demilitarized zone.</li>
                <li><strong>What happens at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant?</strong> The status of Europe's largest nuclear facility remains unresolved and poses ongoing safety risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Can a referendum be held?</strong> Zelenskyy insists any peace deal must be approved by Ukrainian voters, but this would require a 60-day ceasefire that Russia has not agreed to.</li>
                <li><strong>Will the "Putin residence attack" derail talks?</strong> Russia's claim of a Ukrainian drone strike on Putin's residence has already led Moscow to announce it will "revise" its negotiating position.</li>
                <li><strong>Can Ukraine hold out militarily?</strong> With Russian forces making steady gains and Ukraine's energy infrastructure under siege, Kyiv's ability to continue fighting depends on sustained Western support.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> While there is unprecedented momentum toward a peace framework, the gap between Russian and Ukrainian positions on territory remains substantial. The coming weeks will test whether Trump's mediation can bridge this divide or whether the conflict will grind on through its fourth year.
