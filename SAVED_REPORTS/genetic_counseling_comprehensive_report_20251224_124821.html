        </header>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Genetic counseling is a rapidly growing healthcare profession at the intersection of medical genetics and counseling. Genetic counselors are master's-trained healthcare professionals who combine expertise in genetics with counseling skills to help individuals and families understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease. The profession has grown exponentially in recent years, with over 400% growth in certified genetic counselors since 1992, and projections indicate the field will double in size by 2030.</p>
            <p>This report provides a comprehensive overview of genetic counseling as a career, including educational requirements, certification pathways, job outlook, salary information, and practical guidance for aspiring genetic counselors.</p>

            <h2>1. What is Genetic Counseling?</h2>
            <p>According to the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC), genetic counseling is defined as "the process of helping people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease." This process integrates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interpretation of family and medical histories to assess disease risk</li>
                <li>Education about inheritance, testing, management, and prevention</li>
                <li>Counseling to promote informed choices and adaptation to risk</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Genetic counselors work in diverse settings including hospitals, specialty clinics, diagnostic laboratories, research institutions, public health departments, biotechnology companies, and private practice. They serve as liaisons between complex genetic information and patient understanding, often working as part of multidisciplinary healthcare teams.</p>
