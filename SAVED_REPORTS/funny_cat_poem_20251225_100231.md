A Christmas Cat Carol

'Twas the night before Christmas, or close enough,
When twelve furry friends decided they'd had enough
Of old Scrooge McTabby, so grumpy and gray,
Who'd hiss "Bah Humbug!" at their holiday play.

From "Catnip & Co." to the lamppost so bright,
These festive felines took over the night!
With sweaters of red, green, purple, and blue,
They gathered in numbers - a festive cat crew.

One orange cat tugged at the wreath with delight,
While others held fish treats with appetite quite light.
The Santa-hat tabby, so jolly and round,
Led the cat-carol chorus, the happiest sound!

Old Grumpy-Cat Scrooge, with his cane and his frown,
Watched from his doorway, not looking down.
He couldn't resist their purrs and their glee,
These cats in their sweaters, so wild and so free!

They knocked down the wreath in their playful charade,
But nobody cared - the celebration stayed!
For Christmas with cats is a joyous affair,
Even when Scrooge-cat is acting like... a Scrooge-cat (but we love him anyway!)

So here's to the cats, in their holiday gear,
Spreading Christmas cheer far and near!
Meowy Christmas to all, and to all a good night,
May your days be filled with treats and catnip delight! 🎄🐱
