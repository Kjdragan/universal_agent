# Russia-Ukraine War Report: Developments December 19-26, 2025

## Executive Summary

The period of December 19-26, 2025, marked a critical week in the Russia-Ukraine war, characterized by intensified diplomatic negotiations alongside continued heavy fighting. US and Ukrainian negotiators reached consensus on a 20-point peace plan in Florida, though significant disagreements remain on territorial control and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued their gradual territorial advances, claiming control of approximately 5,100 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in 2025, while Ukraine expanded its targeting of Russian oil infrastructure, including tanker attacks in the Mediterranean. The humanitarian situation deteriorated with massive Russian drone and missile strikes killing civilians across 13 Ukrainian regions.

## Diplomatic and Political Updates

**Major Breakthrough:**

- Higher military cap (800,000 vs 600,000)

## Future Outlook and Projections

### Potential Endgame Scenarios

**Analyst Perspectives:**
- Former Ukrainian deputy chief of staff: only realistic achievement could be "pause" in war, not full end
- "Window of opportunity" for peace deal may emerge in second half of 2026 if Russia doesn't breach frontline
- War could continue into 2027 if Moscow doesn't realize Kyiv can stomach war of attrition

**Historical Models:**
Academic analysis identifies five possible war-termination scenarios:

1. **Burnout Model** (Iran-Iraq War): Prolonged attrition until both sides exhausted - carries risks of frozen lines and incomplete sovereignty

2. **Korean-Style Armistice**: Military agreement suspending hostilities without political treaty - would reduce attrition but at cost of territorial integrity and incomplete sovereignty

3. **Finlandization**: Ukraine preserves statehood but concedes territory and adopts strategic neutrality - politically unlikely given public opinion

4. **India-Pakistan Recurring Crisis**: Unresolved disputes producing cycles of limited wars and crisis bargaining - would trap Ukraine in instability cycle

5. **Georgian Scenario**: Russia maintains partial occupation while cultivating pro-Russian government - would jeopardize reconstruction and democratic institutions

### Putin's Imperial Ambitions

**Expansionist Objectives:**
- Putin framing war as crusade to reverse Russia's post-Soviet retreat
- Reference to "Novorossiya" encompassing approximately half of Ukraine including entire Black Sea coastline
- Putin stated: "I have said many times that I consider the Russian and Ukrainian peoples to be one people. In this sense, all of Ukraine is ours"
- Putin defined Soviet Union as "historical Russia" and called its dissolution "the disintegration of historical Russia"
- Rule: "Wherever a Russian soldier sets foot is ours"

**Potential Future Targets:**
Based on Czarist Empire boundaries, potential targets could include Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Central Asian nations

**US Intelligence Assessment:**
- Intelligence confirms Putin has not abandoned aims of capturing all Ukraine and reclaiming parts of former Soviet Empire
- "The Europeans are convinced of it. The Poles are absolutely convinced of it. The Baltics think they're first"

### Challenges to Peace

**Kremlin's Uncompromising Stance:**
- Continued commitment to achieving original war goals from 2022
- Rejection of compromises embodied in 20-point and 28-point plans
- Demands incompatible with any peace agreement preserving Ukrainian sovereignty

**Military Realities:**
- Russia lacks sufficient manpower to maintain multi-pronged offensives
- Ukrainian forces demonstrating resilience despite being outmanned and outgunned
- Fortress Belt cities (Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, Kostyantynivka) remain formidable obstacles

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Putin's expansionist appetite not sated by limited territorial gains
- Any peace leaving 80% of Ukraine beyond Kremlin control would be recognized in Moscow as historic defeat
- Russian society deeply militarized in ways difficult to reverse
- Hundreds of thousands of brutalized soldiers create national security priority to keep them occupied

### Timeframes

**Public Opinion:**
- Majority of Russians expect war to end in 2026
- Many Ukrainians growing wearier of war, shelling, and economic downturn
- Public sentiment in Ukraine: "Donetsk was the source of our problems. Let Russia have it and pay tens of billions to restore it"

**Negotiation Prospects:**
- Even if Putin agrees to deal in 2026, would take months to implement
- If war's "dead-lock" becomes clear to Moscow in 2025, hope for deal by late 2025
- Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and envoy Steve Witkoff continuing shuttle diplomacy
