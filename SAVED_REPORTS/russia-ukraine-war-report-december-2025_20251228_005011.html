            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>The Russia-Ukraine war continues to evolve through a critical phase as diplomatic initiatives intensify alongside persistent military operations. This report synthesizes developments from mid-to-late December 2025, capturing key events and trends.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Massive Russian Strikes:</strong> Russia launched its largest combined drone and missile attack of the war on December 26-27, striking energy infrastructure across Ukraine with 519 drones and 40 missiles, leaving nearly 600,000 people in Kyiv without power and heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Diplomatic Momentum:</strong> A 20-point peace framework, negotiated between the United States and Ukraine with European input, is reportedly 90% complete. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on December 28 to finalize key provisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Battlefield Dynamics:</strong> Russian forces continue gradual advances, gaining approximately 138 square miles (357 square km) of Ukrainian territory between November 25 and December 22, 2025, though progress remains slow and costly.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Challenges:</strong> Russia is unable to build a strategic reserve and lacks the manpower for rapid breakthroughs, suggesting the war of attrition will likely continue into 2026 at current pacing.</li>
                <li><strong>Kremlin Intransigence:</strong> Russian officials, including Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, have signaled they will not sign peace agreements "right now" and continue to demand conditions unacceptable to Ukraine and its Western partners.</li>

                    <p>Russia conducted its largest-scale combined drone and missile strike of the war, launching 519 Shahed-type and other strike drones, 10 Iskander-M/Kinzhal ballistic missiles, 7 Iskander-K/Kalibr cruise missiles, 21 Kh-101 cruise missiles, and 2 Kh-22 cruise missiles at Ukrainian critical infrastructure. Ukrainian forces downed 474 drones and 29 missiles. The attack primarily targeted Kyiv, killing at least two people and injuring 32 others, including two children. Nearly 600,000 residents in Kyiv City and Kyiv Oblast lost power, with one-third of the capital left without heat as temperatures hovered around freezing.</p>

            <h2>2. Current Situation Analysis</h2>

            <h3>Territorial Control</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Russian Gains:</strong> According to Russia Matters' analysis of ISW data, Russian forces gained approximately 138 square miles of Ukrainian territory between November 25 and December 22, 2025. In the six days from December 16-22 alone, Russia gained 51 square miles. Since January 1, 2025, Russia has averaged territorial gains of 176 square miles per month.</p>
                
                <div class="stat-box">
                    <div class="number">19.2%</div>
                    <div class="label">of Ukrainian territory under Russian occupation (as of Dec 22, 2025)</div>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Total Occupation:</strong> As of December 22, 2025, Russian forces occupied approximately 116,057 square kilometers (44,810 square miles) of Ukrainian land—an area roughly equivalent to the U.S. state of Ohio.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ukrainian Counterattacks:</strong> Ukraine has made tactical gains in Kupyansk, with Ukrainian forces liberating most of the city according to geolocated footage and Russian milblogger acknowledgments. In the Oleksandrivka direction, Ukrainian forces liberated five settlements—Orestopil, Novoselivka, Sosnivka, Khoroshe, and Vorone—during an operation lasting over 100 days since mid-September.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Military Balance</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Russian Manpower Constraints:</strong> According to Ukrainian GUR Head Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, Russia fulfilled its plan to recruit 403,000 people in 2025 and plans to increase mobilization to 409,000 in 2026. However, Russia has not yet developed a strategic reserve to desired capabilities and "constantly" activates its operational reserve to support ongoing combat operations.</p>

                <p><strong>Pace of Advances:</strong> Russian forces are currently unable to build out a strategic reserve and will therefore likely be constrained to "grinding, slow advances at their current rate and scale in the coming year," according to ISW assessments. The requirement to draw reserves from some sectors to focus on operationally significant undertakings often leaves flanks undermanned, creating vulnerabilities that Ukrainian forces can exploit to counterattack and retake land.</p>

                <p><strong>Weather Impact:</strong> Foggy, wintry conditions have significantly complicated Ukrainian infantry and drone surveillance, allowing Russian forces to advance in small assault groups and infiltrate Ukrainian positions. Sub-zero temperatures are degrading both Russian and Ukrainian drone operations but have not halted Russian assaults.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Strategic Assessment</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Russian Information Warfare:</strong> There is evidence of a pervasive culture of false reporting within the Russian military command. False reports from commanders have reportedly shaped Putin's understanding of the battlefield situation, leading him to believe Russia can win a war of attrition. The Kremlin's cognitive warfare effort aims to paint Ukrainian defenses as on the verge of collapse and major Russian battlefield victories as inevitable.</p>

                <p><strong>Kremlin Demands:</strong> Russian officials continue to demand conditions unacceptable to Ukraine, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ukraine's complete withdrawal from all of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts</li>
                    <li>Ukraine's abandonment of its NATO membership aspirations and commitment to neutrality</li>
                    <li>Ukraine's "demilitarization" and "denazification" (regime change)</li>
                    <li>International recognition of Russia's annexations</li>
                    <li>Lifting of all Western sanctions against Russia</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Putin's Position:</strong> On December 25, Putin reportedly stated he is ready to make the "concessions" he offered during the August 2025 Alaska Summit—possibly referring to reported willingness to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine including China or Russia as guarantors. However, Putin has also said that if Kyiv authorities are not willing to end the matter peacefully, Russia will achieve all its goals by military means.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Diplomatic Developments</h2>

            <h3>The 20-Point Peace Framework</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Zelenskyy stated that a 20-point peace plan negotiated between Ukraine, the United States, and European partners is "90 percent ready." He is meeting with Trump on December 28 in Florida to finalize remaining issues, with European leaders joining virtually.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Provisions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Territory:</strong> The plan calls for the war to freeze along current frontlines in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts as of the date of signing, rather than Ukraine withdrawing from unoccupied Donbas as earlier U.S. proposals envisioned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demilitarized/Free Economic Zone:</strong> A proposal to create a demilitarized or "free economic zone" in the portion of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine still controls, contingent on Russian withdrawal from corresponding territory. This would be determined by a Ukrainian referendum.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP):</strong> This remains one of the most difficult unresolved issues. The U.S. has proposed creating a consortium with Ukraine and Russia, in which each party would have an equal stake. Zelenskyy has countered with a proposal for a joint venture between the U.S. and Ukraine, in which the Americans would independently decide how to distribute their 50% share, potentially giving some to Russia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Guarantees:</strong> Separate documents outline security guarantees for Ukraine that mirror NATO's Article 5 collective defense provisions. Zelenskyy noted the U.S. position is that this represents an "unprecedented step" toward Ukraine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Military Size:</strong> Ukraine's peacetime military would be capped at 800,000 personnel, up from earlier proposals that capped it at 600,000.</li>
                    <li><strong>NATO Membership:</strong> The 20-point plan does not mention Ukraine's possible NATO membership, though references may be in unpublished accompanying documents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reconstruction:</strong> A "Roadmap for Ukraine's Prosperity" outlines post-war recovery and economic development, with Ukraine seeking approximately $700-800 billion for reconstruction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elections:</strong> The plan requires Ukraine to hold elections after the signing of the agreement, addressing U.S. and Kremlin calls for votes during martial law.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Russian Position</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Kremlin Rejection:</strong> Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated on December 26 that Russia will not sign any peace agreements to end the war in Ukraine "right now" and rejected the 20-point plan, claiming it "differs radically" from points Russia has been working on with the United States. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would decide its position based on information received by Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev from talks with U.S. representatives in Miami.</p>
                <p><strong>Ultimatums:</strong> Russian officials continue to demand that any peace agreement must completely address the ultimatums Russia issued to the West in late 2021, which effectively called for the destruction of the NATO alliance and a radical restructuring of Europe's security architecture.</p>
                <p><strong>No Compromise on Demands:</strong> State Duma International Affairs Committee First Deputy Head Alexei Chepa criticized the plan's lack of a provision prohibiting Ukrainian membership in NATO. A source close to the Kremlin told Bloomberg that Russia will likely seek changes to the plan, including lacking guarantees prohibiting NATO's eastward expansion, insufficient limits on Ukraine's military, and no provisions about frozen Russian assets or sanctions relief.</p>

                <p><strong>Trump's Position:</strong> In an interview with POLITICO, Trump cast himself as the ultimate arbiter of any peace deal, stating of Zelenskyy's latest proposal: "He doesn't have anything until I approve it. So we'll see what he's got." The president appeared lukewarm to Zelenskyy's overture but said he believed he could have a productive meeting.</p>
                <p><strong>U.S. Leverage:</strong> Zelenskyy told reporters that the "mood of the United States of America is that this is an unprecedented step towards Ukraine on their part. They believe that they are giving strong security guarantees."</p>

            <h3>Attacks on Infrastructure</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Ukrainian Long-Range Strikes:</strong> Ukraine continues targeting Russian oil and energy infrastructure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Struck the Novoshakhtinsk Petroleum Products Plant in Rostov Oblast (Storm Shadow missiles)</li>
                    <li>Hit the Temryuk seaport in Krasnodar Krai, causing a 4,000 square meter fire that engulfed two oil storage tanks</li>
                    <li>Attacked a military airfield near Maykop, Adygea Republic</li>
                    <li>Struck the Orenburg Gas Processing Plant in Orenburg Oblast</li>
                    <li>Targeted the Efremov Synthetic Rubber Plant in Tula Oblast, which produces components for explosives and solid rocket fuel</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Russian Strikes on Ukraine:</strong> Russia's campaign against Ukrainian energy infrastructure continues, with recent strikes targeting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Energy and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv City and Kyiv Oblast (December 26-27 attack)</li>
                    <li>Naftogaz's thermal power plant and gas production facilities with Shahed drones</li>
                    <li>Industrial and port infrastructure in Odesa Oblast, damaging equipment for grain transport</li>
                    <li>Energy infrastructure in Chernihiv Oblast</li>
                    <li>Thermal power plant in Kharkiv City suburbs (December 23-24), killing at least one person and injuring 13</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Equipment and Technology</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Drone Warfare:</strong> Both sides continue to expand and integrate drone units into their military structures. Russia appointed Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Vaganov as commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces (USF), and the Russian MoD announced formation of a new USF regiment. Ukraine's USF Commander Robert Brovdi was similarly a businessman before the war, suggesting Russia is trying to replicate Ukraine's successful model.</p>

                <p><strong>Mechanized Assaults:</strong> Russian forces conducted a company-sized mechanized assault in the Dobropillya direction on December 22, consisting of one tank, nine MT-LBs, an armored recovery vehicle, a bridge layer, and four quad bikes. Ukrainian forces destroyed the tank, six MT-LBs, and the bridge. Geolocated footage from December 26 showed another failed Russian mechanized assault north of Novotoretske, involving one tank, nine MT-LBs, an armored recovery vehicle, a bridge layer, and four quad bikes. ISW assesses these demonstrate Russian forces have failed to restore mechanized maneuver to the battlefield.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Russia:</strong> Estimates range from approximately 500,000 to over 1,000,000 killed or wounded (including 240,000 killed according to British intelligence), depending on the source and time period.</li>

                    <li>Ukraine's energy infrastructure was operating at only about 50% of its pre-invasion generation capacity as of Fall 2025</li>
                    <li>ISW estimated in December 2025 that Russia's strike campaign is splitting Ukraine's power grid east-west, with eastern regions "at the brink" of blackout and Kyiv also at risk</li>

            <h2>6. Outlook and Projections</h2>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>War Duration</h3>
                <p>Analysts suggest the war is likely to continue into 2026 and potentially beyond:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ISW Assessment:</strong> Russian forces will likely continue fighting at their current scale and rate of advance. Russian forces are constrained not only by lack of mobilized military personnel but also because the Russian MoD has optimized forces for positional warfare instead of focusing on restoring maneuver warfare.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyst Projections:</strong> Various analysts cited by Al Jazeera suggested the war could continue into 2027 without a diplomatic breakthrough. One analyst noted that even if Putin agrees to a deal, it would take months to finalize.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peace Prospects:</strong> A "window of opportunity" to sign a peace deal may emerge in the second half of 2026 if Russia does not succeed in breaching the front line rapidly and realizes Kyiv can withstand a war of attrition.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Key Variables</h3>
                <p><strong>Factors That Could End or Prolong the War:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Western Support:</strong> Continued and decisive Western military aid is crucial for Ukraine's ability to resist. The $800 million Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative recently passed by the U.S. Senate provides funding for the next two years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Russian Resources:</strong> Russia has enough resources to continue the war for at least another two years, especially given weak sanctions enforcement as many nations continue trading with Moscow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ukrainian Mobilization:</strong> Ukraine's ability to mobilize sufficient manpower remains a constraint. One analyst criticized Ukraine's government as "indecisive and cowardly" regarding mobilization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diplomatic Pressure:</strong> The extent to which the U.S. and Europe can pressure Russia to negotiate, or pressure Ukraine to make territorial concessions, remains uncertain.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                <p><strong>Possible Endings:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pause/Freeze:</strong> The most realistic achievement could be a "pause" in the war, though one analyst said there won't be peace with Russia until Ukraine liberates all lands within its 1991 borders.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Finnish Scenario":</strong> Kyiv recognizes Moscow-occupied regions as part of Russia, similar to Moscow's 1939-40 war with Finland in which Helsinki ceded territory.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Georgian Scenario":</strong> Ukraine maintains no control over occupied areas but refuses to recognize them as Russian, similar to the situation after Russia's 2008 war with Georgia.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Interim" Scenario:</strong> The war is frozen and talks continue without resolution.</li>
                </ul>
