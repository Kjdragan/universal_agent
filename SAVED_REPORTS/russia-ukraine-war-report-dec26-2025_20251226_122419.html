        <h1>Russia-Ukraine War Comprehensive Report</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #7f8c8d; font-style: italic;">December 26, 2025 | Day 1,401 of the Full-Scale Invasion</p>

        <div class="executive-summary">
            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>As the Russia-Ukraine war enters its fifth year in February 2026, the conflict has reached a critical juncture characterized by intense diplomatic activity alongside devastating military escalation. Peace negotiations led by the United States have progressed to a 20-point draft proposal, yet fundamental disagreements remain unresolved, particularly regarding territorial control in eastern Ukraine and the status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue incremental territorial advances, gaining approximately 51 square miles in the week of December 16-22 alone, while simultaneously conducting a relentless campaign of airstrikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.</p>
            
            <p>The humanitarian situation has deteriorated markedly, with Russian attacks on energy infrastructure causing widespread power outages affecting millions of Ukrainians during freezing winter temperatures. A particularly devastating attack on December 22-23, 2025, involving over 650 drones and three dozen missiles across 13 Ukrainian regions, killed at least three civilians including a four-year-old child. Despite these assaults, Ukrainian forces have demonstrated resilience, conducting successful counterattacks near Kupyansk and striking Russian military and energy infrastructure deep behind enemy lines.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps most alarmingly, U.S. intelligence assessments continue to indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin has not abandoned his maximalist war aims of capturing all of Ukraine and potentially reclaiming other territories of the former Soviet empire. This reality casts doubt on the prospects for a lasting peace settlement and raises profound concerns about European security architecture regardless of how the current conflict in Ukraine concludes.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Recent Developments (Past Week)</h2>
        
        <h3>Massive Christmas-Eve Airstrikes</h3>
        <p>In what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy termed a "deliberate and cynical" attack on the eve of Christmas, Russian forces launched their largest combined drone and missile barrage in months on the night of December 22-23. The assault involved more than 650 drones and approximately three dozen missiles targeting 13 regions across Ukraine. The strikes primarily focused on energy infrastructure, causing extensive damage to power generation and transmission facilities in western Ukraine, which Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko noted was "hit the hardest."</p>
        
        <div class="stat-box">
            Casualties and Damage from December 22-23 Attacks:
            <ul>
                <li>At least 3 civilians killed, including a 4-year-old child in Zhytomyr region</li>
                <li>280,000 households in Odesa region initially left without power (220,000 later restored)</li>
                <li>Emergency power cuts implemented across multiple regions</li>
                <li>Energy facilities in western Ukraine sustained heaviest damage</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Peace Talks Advance Despite Obstacles</h3>
        <p>Simultaneously with the escalated violence, intensive diplomatic efforts have continued in Florida, where U.S., Ukrainian, and European negotiators have refined a 20-point peace plan. Zelenskyy revealed details of the proposal on December 23, describing it as representing significant progress while acknowledging that "sensitive issues" remain unresolved, particularly concerning the Donetsk region and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.</p>

        <p>The talks have involved separate meetings between U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner with Ukrainian and Russian delegations. While both sides have described the discussions as "productive and constructive," Vice President JD Vance struck a more sober note, stating that while there's "a good chance" of reaching a peaceful resolution, there's equally "a good chance we won't."</p>

        <h3>Territorial Shifts on the Battlefield</h3>
        <p>Military developments on the ground present a mixed picture. According to Russia Matters' analysis of Institute for the Study of War (ISW) data, Russian forces gained approximately 138 square miles of Ukrainian territory between November 25 and December 22, with 51 square miles captured in just six days between December 16-22. This represents an average monthly gain of 176 square miles since January 1, 2025. Russia currently controls roughly 19-20% of Ukrainian territory, including areas seized prior to the full-scale invasion.</p>

        <p>However, Ukrainian forces have achieved notable successes in the Kupyansk direction, regaining positions that Russian forces had previously claimed to control. Kremlin-affiliated Russian milbloggers acknowledged significant Ukrainian counterattacks, with one admitting that Russian forces had lost control of areas on the west bank of the Oskil River. These developments have led to rare public criticism of the Russian military command for exaggerating gains and providing false reports to senior leadership.</p>

        <h2>Military Situation Updates</h2>

        <h3>Russian Offensive Operations</h3>
        <p>Russian forces have continued offensive operations along multiple fronts, with particularly intense activity in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. The Institute for the Study of War reports that Russian forces have made incremental advances near Hulyaipole, with geolocated footage indicating Russian movement in southern and central areas of the town. However, ISW assesses that some reported advances represent infiltration missions rather than permanent territorial changes.</p>

        <p>In the Sumy region of northern Ukraine, Russian forces have attempted a breakthrough, with fighting reported in the village of Grabovske. The Ukrainian ombudsman reported that Russian troops forcibly moved approximately 50 civilians from the village into Russia. This marks a renewed Russian advance in a part of Sumy region that had been largely spared intense ground fighting since Ukraine regained territory there in 2022.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Key Frontline Status:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pokrovsk Direction:</strong> Ukrainian forces maintain control of parts of Myrnohrad despite Russian claims of full encircment. Well-trained Russian drone operators are creating significant difficulties for Ukrainian defenders.</li>
                <li><strong>Kupyansk Direction:</strong> Ukrainian forces recently advanced along the P-79 highway, regaining positions that Russian sources had previously claimed to control. Russian milbloggers criticized their military command for exaggerating gains in the area.</li>
                <li><strong>Siversk Direction:</strong> Russian forces using fiber-optic drone technology have established positions in the Serebryanske forest area, conducting small-group assaults using ghillie suits and thermal cloaks to evade detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Zaporizhzhia Direction:</strong> Russian forces conducting glide bomb strikes and fiber-optic drone attacks from extended ranges (over 22 kilometers) against Ukrainian positions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Ukrainian Long-Range Strike Campaign</h3>
        <p>Ukrainian forces have continued their campaign targeting Russian military and energy infrastructure deep behind enemy lines. Notable strikes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two Russian Su-27 fighter jets at Belbek Airbase near occupied Sevastopol in Crimea</li>
            <li>Long-range radar systems, air defense systems, and a MiG-31 interceptor at Belbek Airbase</li>
            <li>A Project 22460 Okhotnik-class patrol boat near oil and gas facilities in the Caspian Sea</li>
            <li>The Efremov Synthetic Rubber Plant in Tula Oblast, which produces components for explosives and solid rocket fuel</li>
            <li>A Russian Il-38N maritime patrol aircraft at Yeysk Airbase</li>
            <li>Oil storage facilities at Temryuk port in southern Russia and the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov region</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These strikes are part of a systematic Ukrainian campaign to degrade Russia's ability to wage war by targeting critical defense infrastructure and economic resources supporting the military effort.</p>

        <h3>Energy Infrastructure Under Sustained Attack</h3>
        <p>Russian forces have intensified their campaign against Ukrainian energy infrastructure, particularly targeting power generation facilities in western and eastern Ukraine. The December 22-23 strikes followed earlier attacks on December 17 that hit electrical substations in Odesa region, leaving 280,000 households without power. Russian forces have also struck the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant's external power lines, leaving it operating with only one of two external power connections.</p>

        <p>According to Russia Matters' analysis, Ukraine has lost approximately 64% of its electricity generating capacity to destruction or occupation as of 2024. The country's thermal power generation capacity has been severely damaged, with ISW estimating in December 2025 that Russia's strike campaign is systematically splitting Ukraine's power grid east-west, potentially pushing eastern regions "to the brink" of blackout.</p>

        <h2>Diplomatic Efforts and Peace Talks</h2>

        <h3>The 20-Point Peace Plan</h3>
        <p>President Zelenskyy unveiled the latest iteration of the peace proposal on December 23, describing it as a 20-point plan developed through U.S.-Ukrainian-European cooperation. The document represents a significant evolution from the earlier 28-point proposal from November 2025. Key differences include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Territorial Provisions:</strong> The new plan calls for the conflict to freeze in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts along the frontline as of the agreement's signing date, rather than requiring Ukraine to withdraw from remaining unoccupied Donbas territory.</li>
            <li><strong>Military Constraints:</strong> The plan caps Ukraine's peacetime military at 800,000 personnel, compared to 600,000 in the earlier proposal.</li>
            <li><strong>NATO Membership:</strong> The new document makes no mention of Ukraine abandoning its NATO membership aspirations, a point that was explicit in the November proposal.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Zelenskyy emphasized that consensus has been reached on most points but identified two major remaining issues: control over territories in the Donetsk region and the management of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The Ukrainian president stated that Ukraine and the U.S. had spent approximately 15 hours discussing the nuclear plant issue alone.</p>

        <h3>Unresolved Contentious Issues</h3>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Donbas Territory Dispute</h4>
            <p>The most difficult point in the negotiations concerns the future of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russia continues to assert maximalist demands, insisting that Ukraine relinquish all remaining territory in Donbas that it has not already captured—an ultimatum Ukraine has firmly rejected. The United States has proposed transforming these areas into free economic zones, while Ukraine insists any arrangement must be contingent upon a referendum allowing Ukrainians to determine their own fate. Ukraine is demanding demilitarization of the area and the presence of an international force to ensure stability.</p>
            
            <p>According to NPR's reporting, Russia has captured most of Luhansk oblast and approximately 70% of Donetsk. The approximately 15% of Donbas that remains under Ukrainian control includes several heavily fortified cities and towns that Ukraine considers essential for its security.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant</h4>
            <p>The status of Europe's largest nuclear facility, which remains under Russian occupation, represents another major sticking point. The U.S. has proposed a consortium with Ukraine and Russia, with each party holding an equal 33% stake and American management. Zelenskyy countered with a proposal for a joint venture between the U.S. and Ukraine, in which Americans could independently determine how to distribute their 50% share.</p>
            
            <p>"How can you have joint commerce with the Russians after everything?" Zelenskyy asked, expressing Ukrainian skepticism about working with Russia at the facility. The Ukrainian president noted that billions in investments would be needed to restore the plant to operation, including repairing the adjacent dam.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>U.S. and Russian Positions</h3>
        <p>U.S. officials have acknowledged that significant disagreements remain. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that both Russia and Ukraine must make compromises to end the war, telling reporters that "the hardest issues are always the last issues." He emphasized that the United States cannot force either party to accept a deal: "We can't force Ukraine to make a deal. We can't force Russia to make a deal. They have to want to make a deal."</p>

        <p>Vice President JD Vance offered an even more pessimistic assessment, stating that while he believes there's "a good chance" of reaching a peaceful resolution, there's equally "a good chance we won't." He noted that Ukrainian forces would likely lose the remaining portion of the Donbas region regardless if fighting persists, but acknowledged that Ukraine views Russian control of the area as a "major security problem."</p>

        <p>Russian officials have signaled skepticism about Western proposals. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described peace negotiations as a "working progress" rather than a turning point. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said there had been "slow progress" while criticizing what he termed European and Ukrainian "extremely harmful, malicious attempts... to torpedo" the peace talks.</p>

        <h3>Security Guarantees</h3>
        <p>A central element of the negotiations involves security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent renewed Russian aggression. The draft proposal reportedly includes security guarantees that mirror NATO's Article 5, which obligates members to respond to an attack against one member. However, the Kremlin has stated it would not accept Western troops within Ukraine as part of any peace deal.</p>

        <p>The United States is reportedly preparing a separate bilateral document with Ukraine outlining these guarantees, including specific conditions under which security would be provided and mechanisms to monitor a ceasefire using satellite technology and early warning systems.</p>

        <h2>Humanitarian Impact</h2>

        <h3>Civilian Casualties and Displacement</h3>
        <p>The human cost of the war continues to mount, with Russian attacks increasingly targeting civilian infrastructure. The December 22-23 attacks alone killed at least three civilians, including a four-year-old child killed when a drone struck a house in Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv. Additional fatalities were reported in Kyiv and Khmelnytskyi regions.</p>

        <p>According to United Nations estimates, approximately 3 to 3.5 million Ukrainians are living under Russian occupation as of 2024, while the occupied territories have lost roughly half of their pre-war population. Since the full-scale invasion began, approximately 10.6 million Ukrainians have been displaced, representing about 24% of the country's pre-invasion population of 44 million.</p>

        <h3>Energy Infrastructure and Winter Conditions</h3>
        <p>The systematic Russian campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure has created a humanitarian crisis as winter temperatures drop below freezing. The December attacks caused extensive damage across multiple regions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy facilities in western Ukraine sustained the heaviest damage</li>
            <li>Kharkiv City's thermal power plant was struck, disrupting power generation, heat supplies, and transportation</li>
            <li>Chernihiv City and Oblast reported critical infrastructure strikes affecting tens of thousands of residents</li>
            <li>Kherson City saw attacks on critical and residential infrastructure killing at least one person</li>
            <li>Ukrnafta reported almost 100 strike drones against its production facilities between December 22-24</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These attacks follow earlier strikes on December 17 that damaged electrical substations in the Odesa region, initially cutting power to 280,000 households. While electricity was restored to 220,000 homes, extensive repair work remains needed.</p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            Ukraine Energy Infrastructure Damage (as of late 2025):
            <ul>
                <li>64% of electricity generating capacity destroyed or occupied</li>
                <li>Significant portion of thermal power generation capacity destroyed</li>
                <li>Some hydropower installations damaged or destroyed</li>
                <li>Substantial portion of gas production capacity destroyed ahead of winter</li>
                <li>Overall electricity consumption fallen by approximately 50% since invasion</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Forced Displacement and Deportations</h3>
        <p>Reports continue to emerge of forced displacement of civilians from Russian-occupied or contested areas. In the Sumy region, Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported that Russian troops forcibly moved approximately 50 people from the village of Grabovske into Russia. This follows earlier reports of Russia forcibly moving dozens of people from border villages in the Sumy region.</p>

        <p>The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission has documented severe violations in occupied Ukraine, including executions, enforced disappearances, torture, and the suppression of Ukrainian language and culture. Children are reported to be particularly affected, with schools forced to teach Russian curricula and children enlisted into youth groups that indoctrinate them with Russian nationalism.</p>

        <h2>Economic Consequences</h2>

        <h3>Territorial Control and Economic Impact</h3>
        <p>Russia's territorial gains have come at enormous economic cost to Ukraine. As of December 22, 2025, Russian forces occupied approximately 116,057 square kilometers of Ukrainian land (about 44,810 square miles), constituting 19.2% of Ukrainian territory—an area roughly equivalent to the U.S. state of Ohio. This includes approximately 45,625 square miles total when including Crimea and parts of Donbas seized prior to the full-scale invasion.</p>

        <p>The rate of Russian territorial acquisition has accelerated in 2025 compared to 2024. While Russian forces captured an estimated net 487 square kilometers (about 188 square miles) during the entire year of 2023, they have gained an average of 176 square miles per month since January 1, 2025. In the most recent six-day period alone (December 16-22), Russia gained 51 square miles.</p>

        <h3>Infrastructure Damage Assessment</h3>
        <p>The scale of infrastructure damage is staggering. According to Russia Matters' compilation of various estimates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ukraine's energy infrastructure was operating at only about half its pre-invasion generation capacity as of Fall 2025</li>
            <li>Russian strikes had destroyed or damaged nearly 40% of Russia's oil refining capacity by October 2025, though Reuters estimated the actual processing decline was significantly less</li>
            <li>A journalistic investigation by RFE/RL estimated Ukrainian strikes on Russia's energy sector caused at least 60 billion rubles (approximately $670 million) in damage</li>
            <li>Ukraine had lost substantial portions of its thermal power generation capacity and hydropower installations</li>
            <li>Russia was reported to have destroyed approximately 50% of Ukraine's gas production ahead of the 2025-2026 winter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Economic Growth and Recovery Prospects</h3>
        <p>The economic consequences extend beyond immediate infrastructure damage. Ukraine has experienced profound economic contraction since 2022, though official statistics vary. The proposed peace plan includes economic components aimed at supporting Ukraine's recovery, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accelerated free trade agreements with the United States and European Union</li>
            <li>A "Roadmap for Ukraine's Prosperity" outlining post-war recovery and economic development to 2040</li>
            <li>A global development package covering investments in technology, data centers, artificial intelligence, and gas</li>
            <li>Funds for reconstruction of war-damaged territories</li>
            <li>A target of attracting $800 billion through equity, grants, loans, and private sector contributions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, these economic recovery prospects remain contingent on reaching a sustainable peace agreement and maintaining continued Western support.</p>

        <h2>Future Outlook and Strategic Implications</h2>

        <h3>Putin's Unchanged Maximalist Aims</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant factor shaping the future of the conflict is that U.S. intelligence reports continue to warn that Vladimir Putin has not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and reclaiming parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire. According to Reuters reporting, six sources familiar with the intelligence confirm that recent assessments indicate Putin's goals remain unchanged, contradicting his public denials that he poses a threat to Europe.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"The intelligence has always been that Putin wants more. The Europeans are convinced of it. The Poles are absolutely convinced of it. The Baltics think they're first."</p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 10px;">— Representative Mike Quigley, Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee</p>
        </div>

        <p>The Atlantic Council analysis notes that Putin has explicitly defined his vision of "historically Russian lands" to include the whole of Ukraine. At the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in summer 2025, Putin stated: "I have said many times that I consider the Russian and Ukrainian peoples to be one people. In this sense, all of Ukraine is ours."</p>

        <h3>Broader Imperial Ambitions</h3>
        <p>Analysts warn that Putin's expansionist agenda likely extends beyond Ukraine's borders. The Atlantic Council reports that Putin's vision of historical Russia includes vast expanses of the Czarist Empire and its Soviet successor. In 2022, Putin stated: "What is the Soviet Union? It is historical Russia." A year earlier, he lamented the USSR's collapse as "the disintegration of historical Russia," saying "We turned into a completely different country. And what had been built up over 1,000 years was largely lost."</p>

        <p>Based on the boundaries of the Czarist Empire at its greatest extent, potential targets of future Russian aggression could theoretically include Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, the nations of Central Asia, and former Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe.</p>

        <h3>Peace Plan Prospects and Scenarios</h3>
        <p>Small Wars Journal published a comprehensive analysis of five historical war-termination models and their applicability to Ukraine:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Conflict Burnout Model (Iran-Iraq War 1980-1988):</strong> Prolonged attritional conflict ending only when both sides are too exhausted to continue, typically restoring the status quo rather than producing decisive victory. For Ukraine, this would mean frozen lines, incomplete sovereignty restoration, and gradual erosion of reform momentum.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Korean-Style Armistice:</strong> Military agreement suspending hostilities without a political peace treaty, establishing a demilitarized zone monitored by neutral or joint security mechanisms. This would reduce daily attrition but come with serious strategic costs including loss of territorial integrity and incomplete sovereignty restoration.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Finlandization:</strong> Ukraine preserves statehood but concedes territory in exchange for guarantees of formal sovereignty while adopting strategic neutrality. The analysis notes this would be politically unlikely given Ukrainian public opinion trends strongly favoring EU and NATO membership.</li>
            
            <li><strong>India-Pakistan Recurring Crisis Model:</strong> Unresolved sovereignty disputes producing cycles of escalation, limited wars, and crisis bargaining rather than definitive settlement. This would trap Ukraine in a cycle of instability, force sustained defense mobilization, and embed a long-term security fault line in Europe.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Georgian Scenario:</strong> Russia maintains partial occupation while cultivating or installing pro-Russian government influence in Kyiv. This would mean formal independence paired with deep strategic vulnerability, further fragmenting the country and subjecting it to ongoing territorial pressure.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The Small Wars Journal analysis concludes that "most endgames pose significant risks for Ukraine unless anchored in strong and enduring Western security guarantees." Models that preserve sovereignty and are backed by credible deterrence strategies provide the most promising path to long-term stability.</p>

        <h3>Expert Predictions on War Duration</h3>
        <p>Al Jazeera surveyed Ukrainian military and civilian experts about when the war might end, receiving varied predictions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ihor Romanenko</strong>, former deputy head of Ukraine's general staff, believes the only realistic achievement might be a "pause" in the war rather than full peace. "There won't be peace with Russia until we liberate the lands within Ukraine's [post-Soviet] 1991 borders," he said.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Volodymyr Fesenko</strong> of the Kyiv-based Penta think tank, said "a window of opportunity" to sign a peace deal might emerge in the second half of 2026 if Russia realizes Ukraine can sustain a war of attrition. He noted Ukraine may need to concede parts of the Donetsk region, or the war could continue into 2027.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Ihar Tyshkevich</strong> warned of a possible "Finnish scenario" where Ukraine would be forced to recognize Moscow-occupied regions as part of Russia, or a "Georgian scenario" with no control over occupied areas but Kyiv's refusal to recognize them as Russia's.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Nikolay Mitrokhin</strong> of Germany's Bremen University predicted Ukraine would be "pushed out" of remaining southeastern Donetsk territory, noting Russia has resources to continue the war for at least two more years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>European Security Implications</h3>
        <p>The broader implications for European security are profound. An American Enterprise Institute analysis cited by Small Wars Journal estimates that a Russian victory would force the United States to spend an additional $808 billion over five years to reinforce NATO—nearly seven times the current $112 billion in U.S. support for Ukraine. This would create a 2,600-mile militarized frontier on Europe's eastern border.</p>

        <p>German officials have emphasized that Russia would continue to pose a threat regardless of whether a ceasefire is agreed. Germany's Foreign Minister stated that Moscow would likely try to use any pause in hostilities to prepare an attack on a NATO member, urging allies to "prepare ourselves for the possibility that this may happen."</p>

        <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has warned that Europe could face growing threats if support for Ukraine is reduced, stating that Kyiv's strength is imperative to prevent Putin from attempting to attack a NATO member. He urged alliance members to increase defense spending, saying: "If we do those two things, we are strong enough to defend ourselves, and Putin will never try."</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>Critical Assessment</h3>
            <p>The Atlantic Council's analysis delivers a stark warning: "Putin's vow to liberate historically Russian lands is an open-ended excuse for imperial expansion that makes a complete mockery of US-led efforts to broker a compromise peace based on limited Russian gains in southern and eastern Ukraine. Clearly, this would not be enough to placate Putin and cannot serve as the basis for a sustainable settlement."</p>
            
            <p>The analysis continues: "The peace currently being discussed would leave approximately 80 percent of Ukraine beyond Kremlin control and free to continue integrating with the West. This is exactly what Putin aims to prevent... After four years of fighting to reverse the verdict of the Cold War, any peace deal that safeguards Ukrainian independence would be recognized in Moscow as a Russian defeat of historic proportions."</p>
