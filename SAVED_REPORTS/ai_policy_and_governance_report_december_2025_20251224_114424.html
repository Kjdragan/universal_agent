            <h2>United States Federal AI Policy Developments</h2>
            
            <h3>Trump Administration's Executive Order on AI Governance</h3>
            <p>On December 11, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14365, titled "Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence." The order represents a significant federal intervention in AI governance, specifically targeting what the administration describes as a "patchwork of 50 different regulatory regimes" at the state level. The EO seeks to establish a "minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI" aimed at sustaining U.S. global AI dominance.</p>

                <h4>Key Directives of the Executive Order:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creation of an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws that are inconsistent with U.S. policy, unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by federal regulation, or are otherwise deemed unlawful</li>
                    <li>Secretary of Commerce evaluation of existing state AI laws, with specific focus on laws requiring AI models to alter "truthful" outputs or compel disclosures that might violate constitutional rights</li>
                    <li>Funding restrictions: States with "onerous" AI laws may become ineligible for Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program funding and other discretionary grants</li>
                    <li>FCC proceeding to determine whether to adopt a federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models that would preempt state laws</li>
                    <li>FTC policy statement on whether state laws requiring alterations to "truthful" AI outputs are preempted by federal prohibitions on deceptive acts</li>
                    <li>Preparation of a legislative recommendation for a uniform federal AI governance framework with specific carve-outs for state laws regarding privacy, data protection, civil rights, and "other topics as shall be determined"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>According to Jones Day analysis, the Executive Order "takes aim at" state AI laws that "embed ideological bias" or regulate beyond state borders, potentially implicating laws in Colorado, Illinois, and California. The law firm notes that "significant activity is expected over the next 30 to 180 days" and suggests stakeholders should monitor opportunities for "potentially shaping federal law by submitting comments in any rulemaking process."</p>

            <h2>HHS AI Strategy: Healthcare Transformation</h2>
            
            <p>On December 4, 2025, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a comprehensive 21-page AI strategy representing the "next phase" of the Department's push to integrate AI throughout federal healthcare operations. The strategy follows several directives including the AI Action Plan, Executive Order 14179 ("Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI"), and OMB memoranda M-25-21 and M-25-22.</p>
            
            <p>Led by HHS Acting Chief AI Officer Clark Minor, the strategy emphasizes a "OneHHS" approach—marking the first time in Department history that all divisions including CDC, CMS, FDA, NIH, and others are invited to collaborate on a department-wide AI ecosystem. This approach enables sharing of data, code, and best practices across agencies so that "an AI solution developed by one agency can be leveraged by others."</p>
            
            <div class="pillar-grid">
                <div class="pillar-item">
                    <strong>1. Governance & Risk Management</strong>
                    Establish structures and policies for AI governance to maintain public trust; emphasizes ethics, transparency, security, and civil rights adherence

                <div class="pillar-item">
                    <strong>2. Infrastructure & Platforms</strong>

                <div class="pillar-item">
                    <strong>3. Workforce Development</strong>

                <div class="pillar-item">
                    <strong>4. Research Excellence</strong>

                <div class="pillar-item">

                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Notably, just days before the HHS strategy rollout, the FDA announced its own major AI deployment: a secure, agency-wide "agentic AI" platform allowing all FDA employees to use AI agents for complex, multi-step tasks including regulatory meeting schedules, pre-market product reviews, and post-market surveillance. The FDA announcement emphasized that the AI system includes built-in human oversight and remains optional for employees.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>The strategy establishes concrete implementation directives, including an AI Governance Board led by Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill, an enterprise AI use case inventory with annual reporting requirements, and mandatory risk management practices for high-impact AI systems by April 3, 2026. High-impact AI systems that cannot meet required safeguards by the deadline "must be stopped or phased out until compliance is achieved."</p>

            <h2>Global AI Governance: UN Initiatives</h2>
            
            <p>On December 18, 2025, the United Nations General Assembly concluded the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS+20) review—a process launched in the early 2000s to guide global cooperation on digital development. UN Member States pledged to narrow widening digital divides and implement stronger safeguards around artificial intelligence.</p>
            
            <p>UN General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock noted that while global internet access stands at around two-thirds of the world's population, it remains "far lower" in developing countries, with women and girls "disproportionately left behind." She emphasized that access alone is insufficient, stressing the need for "responsible governance of emerging technologies such as AI."</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Key UN Commitments from WSIS+20:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>People-centred digital future grounded in human rights and multistakeholder principles</li>
                    <li>Faster action to close digital divides and greater investment in digital infrastructure and skills</li>
                    <li>Trustworthy governance of data and AI, building on existing commitments</li>
                    <li>Stronger international partnerships on AI capacity-building for developing countries</li>
                    <li>Establishment of an Independent International Scientific Panel on AI</li>
                    <li>Launch of a Global Dialogue on AI Governance in 2026</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>International Telecommunication Union Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin reflected that WSIS was born from a belief that "digital innovation must reflect human needs," while UNDP Associate Administrator Haoliang Xu described the review as both "a moment to recognize progress and to chart a path forward."</p>

            <p>In December 2025, the Spanish Agency for the Supervision of Artificial Intelligence (AESIA) published comprehensive guidance documents aimed at helping providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems comply with the EU AI Act. The materials, currently available only in Spanish, were developed through Spain's AI regulatory "sandbox" with input from industry, technical experts, and authorities.</p>
            
            <p>According to Inside Privacy reporting, the guidance consists of 16 practical recommendation guides covering implementation of quality management systems, technical documentation, record-keeping, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, robustness, and security. A seventeenth guide explains how to use compliance checklists and is complemented by a free, downloadable toolkit with ready-to-use templates and examples.</p>
            
            <p>AESIA emphasizes these documents are "living resources" subject to regular updates to reflect evolving standards and European Commission guidelines. Spain joins several other EU countries in providing national compliance frameworks:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Germany:</strong> Has issued guidance documents for AI Act compliance</li>
                <li><strong>Netherlands:</strong> Published guidance outlining obligations and risk categories with practical compliance steps</li>
                <li><strong>France:</strong> The CNIL has issued guidance focused on GDPR compliance in AI systems, including data annotation, development security, and model governance</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bahrain: AI for Sustainable Development</h2>
            
            <p>Bahrain is demonstrating how AI can drive public-sector transformation through sustainability-focused initiatives. According to World Economic Forum reporting, Bahrain's Ministry of Sustainable Development partnered with Bain & Company and the WEF to validate AI applications for sustainability in the public sector through a workshop involving more than 30 representatives from 16 government entities.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Bahrain's AI Infrastructure:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supreme Council for Artificial Intelligence launched in July 2025</li>
                    <li>Adoption of GCC's Guiding Manual on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence Use</li>

            <h3>SME SMART: AI-Powered Sustainability Tool</h3>
            <p>Recognizing that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) comprise 99% of establishments in Bahrain and contribute 30% of GDP, the partnership prioritized development of SME SMART (Sustainability Maturity Assessment and Readiness Tool). This AI-powered tool evaluates SME sustainability performance against an international framework through a streamlined questionnaire, generating customized readiness reports with practical recommendations.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="number">$370 billion</div>
                <div class="label">Potential sustainable investment across the MENA region by 2030 through AI-powered tools, representing approximately 45% of the region's net-zero financing gap</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>ROI analysis showed that for every $1 invested in the SME SMART tool, $3 would be mobilized in turn. Bahrain's SMEs could see cumulative benefits of up to $17 million by 2030, enabling expanded operations and access to new financing sources. For Bahrain as a whole, this could support economic diversification and enhance overall competitiveness.</p>
            
            <p>The WEF analysis identifies AI's potential impact across the sustainable investment value chain, from target-setting and policy design (medium AI impact) to investment facilitation and mobilization (high AI impact) to progress tracking and reporting (high AI impact).</p>

            <h2>Academic Perspectives: AI Ethics and Collaboration</h2>
            
            <p>The University of Delaware's Data Science Institute recently sponsored a symposium on artificial intelligence and ethics, featuring keynote speaker Katie Shilton, professor at the University of Maryland's College of Information and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies. Shilton challenged the prevailing "era of 'hurry up and adopt'" with a call for "co-development and participatory AI"—the intentional inclusion of diverse voices during AI system development.</p>
            
            <p>Shilton highlighted growing public mistrust of AI, citing a Pew Research Center study showing that 52% of Americans are more concerned than hopeful about AI's societal impact—a significant gap compared to expert assessments of AI's potential benefits. She argued that "building trust in a scalable way" requires transparency, co-development, and auditing, even though "these methods will slow things down."</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Key Challenges Identified:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI will "hallucinate" and should supplement, not replace, human work</li>
                    <li>Research timelines often extend far beyond corporate deadlines</li>
                    <li>Access to good data remains a significant barrier—particularly when industry partners are reluctant to share findings that may reflect poorly on their practices</li>
                    <li>Students taught ethics may face workplace pressure to "just build it" regardless of ethical considerations</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>Panelists noted that ethics "occupies the space between public opinion and the law" and can be "predictive of law or changes in law by policy." The discussion emphasized that diverse teams bring broader knowledge and experience that helps keep AI development accountable—a principle particularly important for "mission-driven organizations."</p>

            <h2>Conclusion and Outlook</h2>
            
            <p>December 2025 marked a pivotal month for AI governance globally, with significant developments across international bodies, national governments, and the private sector. The Trump Administration's Executive Order signals a decisive move toward federal preemption of state AI regulations, potentially reshaping the U.S. regulatory landscape within 90-180 days. Simultaneously, HHS's comprehensive AI strategy demonstrates how federal agencies are moving beyond planning to active AI deployment across operations.</p>
            
            <p>Internationally, the UN's WSIS+20 conclusion established new frameworks for global AI cooperation, including the planned Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and 2026 Global Dialogue on AI Governance. European Union member states like Spain are operationalizing the EU AI Act through detailed national guidance, while Gulf nations like Bahrain showcase AI's potential for sustainable development in emerging markets.</p>
            
            <p>The pace of activity suggests AI governance will continue evolving rapidly in early 2026, with particular attention on the implementation timelines specified in the U.S. Executive Order and the rollout of HHS's risk management requirements by April 3, 2026. Stakeholders across sectors should monitor these developments closely as they present both opportunities to shape emerging frameworks and compliance obligations to meet.</p>
