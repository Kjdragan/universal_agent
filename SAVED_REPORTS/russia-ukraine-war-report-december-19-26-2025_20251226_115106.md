# Russia-Ukraine War Report: December 19-26, 2025

## Executive Summary

The period of December 19-26, 2025, marked a critical week in the Russia-Ukraine war, characterized by intensified Russian strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure, ongoing peace negotiations in Miami, and continued territorial changes along the front. Russian forces made modest territorial gains, capturing approximately 51 square miles of Ukrainian territory in the week of December 16-22. Meanwhile, US-led shuttle diplomacy produced a 20-point peace plan, though Russia's initial response indicates significant obstacles remain.

## Key Events and Developments

### Peace Negotiations

**US-Brokered Talks in Miami**

The most significant diplomatic development occurred on December 19-20, when US delegations met separately with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in Miami:

- **Ukrainian-European Delegation**: Ukrainian Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov and Chief of the General Staff Major General Andriy Hnatov met with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and former Senior Advisor Jared Kushner on December 19. European representatives from Germany, France, and the UK also joined the talks at the US invitation. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani also participated.

- **Russian Delegation**: Lead Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), met separately with US officials on December 20. Reuters reported that no meeting between Dmitriev and the Ukrainian delegation was planned.

**The 20-Point Peace Plan**

On December 23, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released details of a new US-Ukrainian-European 20-point peace plan. Key provisions include:

- **Territorial Provisions**: The war would freeze along current frontlines in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts as of the agreement's signing date
- **Military Cap**: Ukraine's peacetime military would be capped at 800,000 personnel (increased from 600,000 in earlier proposals)
- **Security Guarantees**: Separate unpublished documents outline security guarantees and US military roles in response to renewed Russian aggression
- **Economic Recovery**: A "Roadmap for Ukraine's Prosperity" document outlines post-war reconstruction

**Key Differences from Earlier Proposals**

The 20-point plan differs significantly from a November 2025 28-point plan:
- No requirement for Ukraine to withdraw from unoccupied Donbas
- No explicit mention of abandoning NATO membership aspirations
- Higher peacetime military cap (800,000 vs 600,000)
- Freezes frontlines in all four occupied oblasts rather than just Zaporizhia and Kherson

**Russian Response**

Kremlin officials have signaled skepticism about the proposal:
- Russian Presidential Aide Yuriy Ushakov stated on December 21 that European and Ukrainian proposals "do not improve" the peace plan
- Russia continues to demand Ukraine's complete withdrawal from all four occupied oblasts
- Moscow seeks recognition of its annexations and lifting of Western sanctions
- Bloomberg reported on December 24 that Russia will likely seek significant changes to the plan, including NATO membership prohibitions and stricter limits on Ukraine's military

**US Official Statements**

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized on December 19 that both Russia and Ukraine must "give something" for peace to be achieved. The framework is being presented to Russia for review, though Ukrainian officials have expressed skepticism about Russia's willingness to compromise.

### Putin's Annual Direct Line (December 19)

Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual televised press conference to reaffirm his commitment to achieving his full war aims:

- Repeated demands from his June 2024 speech: Ukraine's withdrawal from all occupied territories, abandonment of NATO aspirations, demilitarization, and "denazification"
- Claimed Russian forces had seized Siversk (Donetsk Oblast), Vovchansk (Kharkiv Oblast), and significant portions of Lyman and Hulyaipole
- The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed that many of these claims were exaggerated, with evidence showing Russian forces controlled only 7.3% of Hulyaipole and 2.9% of Lyman

## Territorial Changes

### Russian Advances (December 16-22)

According to Russia Matters' analysis of ISW data:
- **51 square miles** gained by Russian forces in the six-day period
- **138 square miles** gained in the longer period of November 25-December 22
- Since January 1, 2025, Russia has gained an average of **176 square miles per month**

### Siversk Capture

Russian forces likely seized Siversk after 41 months of fighting. The town, with a pre-war population of less than 11,000 and an area of about 10 square kilometers, took Russian forces approximately 33 days to fully capture once entering the town limits. Russian forces had advanced roughly 12 kilometers from Lysychansk to Siversk since operations began.

### Ukrainian Counterattacks in Kupyansk

Contrary to Russian claims of controlling Kupyansk, Ukrainian forces have achieved significant successes:
- Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets reported that Ukrainian forces encircled up to two understrength Russian companies in central and southern Kupyansk
- Ukrainian forces have liberated positions in approximately **182.64 square kilometers** in the Kupyansk direction since December 11
- Kremlin-affiliated Russian milbloggers acknowledged that Ukrainian forces had regained positions north and northwest of Kupyansk in Kindrashivka and Radkivka

### Current Territorial Control

As of December 22, 2025:
- Russia occupies approximately **116,057 square kilometers** (44,810 square miles) of Ukrainian territory
- This constitutes **19.2%** of Ukraine's territory
- The area is roughly equivalent to the size of the US state of Ohio
- Including Crimea and territories seized before the 2022 invasion, Russia controls about **45,625 square miles** (roughly 20% of Ukraine)

### Northern Front Developments

Russian forces conducted limited cross-border attacks in Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts:
- **Hrabovske**: Russian forces seized this small rural village southeast of Sumy City, with about 50 civilians forcibly deported to Russia
- **Sotnytskyi Kozachok**: Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault in this Kharkiv Oblast border village
- ISW assessed these attacks as part of a "cognitive warfare campaign" intended to create the appearance of a broad new Russian offensive, rather than actual preparations for a major ground operation

- ISW assesses this false reporting is likely shaping Putin's understanding of the battlefield
- Russian milbloggers have long complained about commanders submitting "beautiful" but erroneous reports

**Resource Strains**:

## Analysis and Outlook

The week of December 19-26, 2025, demonstrated both the possibilities and limitations of diplomatic resolution to the conflict. While the 20-point peace plan represents the most detailed framework yet presented, Russia's insistence on its original maximalist demands—complete Ukrainian withdrawal from occupied territories and abandonment of NATO aspirations—remains a fundamental obstacle.

Militarily, the front continues to see slow, grinding Russian advances at high cost. The 51 square miles gained in a week comes at tremendous casualties, with Ukrainian estimates suggesting 30,000 Russian deaths per month. Meanwhile, Ukraine's successful counterattack in Kupyansk demonstrates that Russian advances are not inevitable.

The intensity of infrastructure attacks on both sides highlights the war's expansion beyond the battlefield. Russia's campaign to split Ukraine's energy grid represents a strategy to pressure Ukrainian civilian society and the government, while Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil infrastructure aim to degrade Russia's war economy.

As peace negotiations continue, the fundamental asymmetry remains: Russia seeks territorial recognition and security guarantees through Ukrainian concessions, while Ukraine seeks security guarantees that would allow it to resist future Russian aggression while maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The gap between these positions—evident in Russia's rejection of even discussing territory issues, as noted by Putin on December 19—suggests that any peace agreement will require difficult compromises or continued conflict.
