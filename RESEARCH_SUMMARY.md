## Major Developments Covered (January 21-25, 2026)

### 1. Historic Trilateral Peace Talks in Abu Dhabi
- **First-ever trilateral negotiations** between Ukraine, Russia, and the US since the 2022 invasion

- **Outcome:** Described as "constructive" and "very productive" but no breakthrough on core territorial dispute

### 2. Core Territorial Dispute: The Donbas Question
- **Russian Demand:** Complete withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from all of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts
- **Ukrainian Position:** Refuses to cede territory it still holds; controls ~6,600 sq km of Donetsk including Sloviansk and Kramatorsk
- **The "Anchorage Formula":** Putin-Trump agreement from August 2025 serves as framework
- **Ukrainian Public Opinion:** ~75% would reject any peace deal requiring territorial withdrawal without security guarantees

### 3. Energy Infrastructure Attacks & Humanitarian Crisis
- **Major Attack:** January 19, 2026 - Russia launched vast aerial assault on Ukrainian energy grid
- **Impact:** 
  - 1.2 million households without power nationwide
  - Over 3,200 buildings in Kyiv without heating (down from 6,000 in morning)
