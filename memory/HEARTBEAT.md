# Agent Heartbeat and Proactive Instructions

This file controls proactive heartbeat behavior. Keep items concrete and actionable.

## Operating Intent

2. Be quiet when there is no actionable item.
3. Prefer execution, then concise status updates.

## Mission Focus
- Build and operate an autonomous AI organization that creates value for Kevin 24/7.
- Prioritize monetization and project execution over passive analysis.

## Execution Windows
- Afternoon execution window: run at least one mission-progress task.
- Night execution window: run at least one mission-progress task.

## Active Monitors and Tasks
- [ ] Mission Control build kickoff
  - Confirm first concrete milestone and produce a short execution checklist.
- [ ] AI-native freelance system progress
