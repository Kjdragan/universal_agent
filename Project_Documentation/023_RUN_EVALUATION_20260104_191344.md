## Phase Performance

| Phase | Duration | Tools Used | Status |
|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| Classification | ~0s | Query classifier | ✅ |
| Search | +17.7s | COMPOSIO_SEARCH_TOOLS, COMPOSIO_MULTI_EXECUTE | ✅ |
| Sub-agent delegation | +20.8s | Task (report-creation-expert) | ✅ |
| Crawling | +52.5s | finalize_research (29/30 URLs) | ✅ |
| Research reading | +67.4s | read_research_files (18 files, 27,935 words) | ✅ |
| Report Generation | +136.6s | write_local_file (31KB HTML) | ✅ |
| PDF Conversion | +143.7s | Bash (Chrome headless) | ✅ |
| Upload to Composio | +159.6s | upload_to_composio | ✅ |
| Email | +167.4s | GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL | ✅ |

**Bottleneck:** Report generation (69s for synthesis) - acceptable for quality

## Happy Path Analysis

### Classification & Routing
- [x] Correctly classified as COMPLEX
- [x] Single iteration (ideal)

### Execution Flow
- [x] No `is_error=True` in tool results
- [x] No error recovery needed

### Sub-Agent Delegation
- [x] `report-creation-expert` used correctly
- [x] Letta memory injected (7188 chars)

### Tool Schema Issues
- [x] No validation failures
- [x] No 0-byte writes

### Email/Identity Resolution
- [x] `recipient_email: "me"` used ✅ (fix verified)
- [x] Email successfully sent with attachment

### PDF Generation
- [x] PDF created (226KB)
- [⚠️] D-Bus errors still present (cosmetic)

---

## Issues Found

### 🟢 LOW: D-Bus Errors in Chrome Headless

**Location:** run.log line 198-200

**Message:** `Failed to connect to the bus: Failed to connect to socket /run/dbus/system_bus_socket`

**Impact:** None - PDF was generated successfully despite errors

**Root Cause:** Chrome headless in WSL/headless environments lacks D-Bus

**Recommendation:** Add `--disable-software-rasterizer --disable-dev-shm-usage` flags (already in SKILL.md, agent didn't use them)

---

## What Worked Well

1. **Complete Pipeline:** All 4 requested tasks completed (research → report → PDF → email)
2. **Crawl Success:** 29/30 URLs (97%)
3. **Trace ID Fix:** 7 distinct local-toolkit trace IDs displayed correctly
4. **Email Resolution:** "me" resolved correctly
5. **Report Quality:** 31KB HTML, 226KB PDF, 18 sections
6. **Single Iteration:** No loops, no retries

---

## Summary

### ✅ FULL PASS

The agent successfully completed the entire pipeline in **169.8 seconds**:

1. **Research:** Searched 3 queries, crawled 29/30 URLs (97% success)
2. **Report:** Generated 31KB HTML with 18 sections
3. **PDF:** Converted to 226KB PDF using Chrome headless
4. **Email:** Sent via GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL with PDF attachment

**All recent fixes verified working:**
- ✅ Trace ID display shows individual IDs (not "consolidated")
- ✅ `recipient_email: "me"` resolves correctly
- ✅ No trace consolidation code (removed)

**Remaining cosmetic issue:**
- D-Bus errors during PDF generation (does not affect output)
