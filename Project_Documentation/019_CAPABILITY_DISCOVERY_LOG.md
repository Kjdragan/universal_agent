# Capability Discovery Log: Phase 8
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Objective**: Explore new functionality beyond "research + email" by testing data analysis, code execution, and multi-tool chaining.

## Planned Stress Tests

### Test 1: Data Analysis Workflow
**Scenario**: Generate sample sales data, perform statistical analysis, create a chart, and email the results.
**Tools Expected**: Remote Workbench (for pandas/matplotlib), Local File I/O, Gmail
**Hypothesis**: Agent should be able to execute Python code remotely to analyze data.

### Test 2: Multi-Tool Chain  
**Scenario**: Search for stock prices, run calculations, generate a summary, and email it.
**Tools Expected**: Tavily Search, Remote Workbench, Gmail
**Hypothesis**: Agent can chain multiple tools in a single workflow without losing context.

### Test 3: Remote Workbench Code Execution
**Scenario**: Ask agent to write and execute a Python script that fetches data from an API.
**Tools Expected**: Remote Workbench with network access
**Hypothesis**: Cloud execution environment has internet access for API calls.
