### Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fifth Year. Here’s Where Things Stand.
**Source:** news.northeastern.edu, 2026-02-23

*   The Russia-Ukraine war is entering its fifth year in a grinding stalemate, described by experts as a "slow drag-out" or "war of attrition" that is "very resource-intensive."
*   The conflict is Europe's largest and deadliest since World War II, with both sides showing no willingness to give ground on the battlefield.
*   Official casualty figures are highly uncertain; the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates over 1.2 million Russian casualties (up to 325,000 killed) and around 600,000 Ukrainian casualties (roughly 140,000 killed).
*   A joint estimate by the BBC Russian Service and Mediazona identifies 186,102 named Russian soldiers killed and puts Ukrainian losses at around 200,000; Russia last reported its own death toll in September 2022 at about 6,000.
*   The war has created one of Europe's largest displacement crises since WWII, with 3.7 million internally displaced people in Ukraine and 5.9 million Ukrainian refugees abroad, totaling over 10.8 million in need of humanitarian assistance.
*   Russia has lost roughly 24,000 military vehicles (including 13,800 tanks and armored vehicles) and Ukraine has lost about 11,300 military vehicles (including 5,570 tanks and armored vehicles), according to Russia Matters.
*   Russia controls approximately 20% of Ukraine's territory (about 116,000 square kilometers, the size of Pennsylvania), with significant portions of eastern and southern Ukraine, plus the Crimean Peninsula.
*   Russia gained roughly 4,800 square kilometers of territory in 2025, but its offensive operations remain sluggish with limited territorial breakthroughs, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

### Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, February 21, 2026
**Source:** criticalthreats.org, 2026-02-21

*   **Ukrainian Advancements:** Ukrainian forces recently advanced near Kupyansk, Novopavlivka, and Oleksandrivka, and continue to hold defensive lines in southern Ukraine.
*   **Ukrainian Strikes:** On the night of February 20-21, Ukraine conducted long-range strikes against Russian defense industrial and energy assets using Ukrainian-produced FP-5 Flamingo cruise missiles, as well as mid-to-long-range strikes against Russian military assets in occupied Ukraine.
*   **Russian Focus and Stalemate:** Russian forces continued offensive operations on February 21 in the Sumy, Kharkiv (Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka, Dobropillya, Pokrovsk, Borova), and Zaporizhzhia (Hulyaipole) directions but made no confirmed advances.
*   **Russian Strategy:** Russia's main effort is in Eastern Ukraine, with three subordinate main efforts: pushing from Belgorod Oblast toward Kharkiv City, capturing the remainder of Luhansk Oblast, and capturing all of Donetsk Oblast.
*   **Russian Supporting Efforts:** Russia aims to create buffer zones in Sumy Oblast and maintain frontline positions in the south, while also securing rear areas against Ukrainian strikes.
*   **Information Warfare:** The Kremlin is intensifying efforts to restrict internet usage and block Telegram in Russia.
*   **Belarusian Support:** Russia has been using Belarusian infrastructure to support drone operations against Ukraine and incursions into NATO airspace.
*   **Methodology:** ISW does not use classified material, basing its reports on publicly available information, including Russian and Ukrainian reporting, social media, and satellite imagery.

### A war foretold: how the CIA and MI6 got hold of Putin’s Ukraine plans and why nobody believed them
**Source:** theguardian.com, 2022-02-07

*   **Early Warnings:** In November 2021, CIA Director William Burns warned President Putin directly of the disastrous consequences of an invasion. After the call, when President Biden asked if Putin would invade, Burns replied, "Yes."
*   **Intelligence Gathered:** US and UK intelligence collected evidence including tens of thousands of Russian troops moving to the border on satellite imagery, suspicious military intercepts, and intelligence pointing to a plan for regime change in Ukraine.
*   **Specific Plans:** By December 2021, intelligence indicated a multi-pronged invasion including troops from Belarus, an airborne assault on Hostomel airport near Kyiv, and a plan to assassinate President Zelenskyy. Lists of "problematic" and pro-Russian figures for post-invasion governance were also compiled.
*   **Skepticism from Allies and Ukraine:** Despite detailed briefings, European intelligence services, haunted by the 2003 Iraq intelligence failures, were skeptical, asking "Why would he?" instead of "Why wouldn't he?". Most believed the buildup was a bluff to pressure Ukraine.
*   **Ukrainian Dismissal:** President Zelenskyy dismissed warnings as scaremongering, fearing it would cause panic and an economic collapse. He released a video telling Ukrainians to remain calm and "not go running to stock up on food and matches."
*   **Limited Ukrainian Preparations:** While Ukraine's intelligence agencies picked up Russian activity, military planning was limited. Army Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhnyi expressed frustration, arguing for martial law to prepare, but official preparations were minimal.
*   **Final Confirmation:** The day before the invasion, Poland's ambassador in Kyiv received a telegram stating, "the invasion will start that night," confirming what the US, UK, and Polish agencies already knew. Germany's intelligence chief, Bruno Kahl, was in Kyiv but oblivious or unperturbed by the warnings.
*   **Intelligence Failures and Successes:** While the CIA and MI6 correctly predicted the invasion, they failed to predict the outcome, assuming Russia's takeover would be swift. They also underestimated Russian capabilities and overestimated them, and Europe's intelligence failed to believe the possibility of war at all. For the CIA and MI6, however, it was a "redemptive moment" after the Iraq controversy.

### The Russia–Ukraine conflict: 1461 days of war
**Source:** lowyinstitute.org, 2026-02-24

*   **Duration and Nature of War:** February 24, 2026, marks 1461 days since Russia's full-scale invasion, described as a brutal "battle of territorial conquest" to destroy Ukrainian culture and prevent it from being an alternative model for the Russian people.
*   **Human Element Over Technology:** Despite significant advancements in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence, the most valuable lesson from the war is the central role of the human spirit, not technology, in determining outcomes.
*   **Impact of Leadership:** President Zelenskyy's decision to stay and lead his nation, rather than accepting evacuation from the US, galvanized the country to fight, raise funds, and defend itself.
*   **Unified National Effort:** Ukraine has demonstrated that democracies can unify to face existential threats, with civilians and soldiers fighting and maintaining a societal warfare effort.
*   **Lessons for the West:** Ukraine serves as a lesson for the West on how to value and defend democracies against authoritarian threats, showing that societies can set aside political divisions to fight for their future.
*   **Human Qualities:** Despite facing some of the 21st century's most brutal conflict, Ukrainian soldiers have retained their essential human qualities and avoided the widespread cruelties inflicted upon civilians by Russian forces.
*   **Political and Strategic Decisions:** The war underscores that it is humans, not robots or AI, who make the crucial political and strategic decisions needed to deter future conflict and inspire societies to be better.

### After four years of Russia's invasion, time to stop underestimating Ukraine - Atlantic Council
**Source:** atlanticcouncil.org, 2026-02-18

*   Russia's full-scale invasion is now entering its fifth year, having lasted longer than the entire conflict between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II.
*   Russian President Vladimir Putin initially planned a brief campaign with approximately 200,000 professional soldiers, reflected in his invasion plan with vast armored columns, and was reportedly so confident that invading units brought their parade uniforms for victory celebrations.
*   Putin's plan failed due to fundamental misjudgments: dismissing Ukraine as an "artificial state" with no national identity and underestimating the scale of popular resistance and the Ukrainian military's capability to wage a modern war.
*   After the initial stage, Russia lost control of the skies and failed at combined arms operations, exposing the reality behind its military superpower pretensions.
*   Ukraine has liberated around half of the land seized by Russia in 2022, decimated the Russian Black Sea Fleet, forced the withdrawal of most Russian warships from Crimea, and now conducts long-range drone and missile strikes deep inside Russia.
*   The war has transformed from a traditional armored conflict to a war of attrition dominated by drones and small infantry groups, with kill zones stretching at least ten kilometers from the front line.
*   Ukraine has become a leading force in drone technology, developing a large and sophisticated domestic industry, and is now training NATO counterparts in drone warfare.
*   As a result of the conflict, Ukraine has emerged as Europe's largest and most innovative military, now seen as indispensable for the continent's security, though Russia has held the battlefield initiative since late 2023, seizing only around 1% more Ukrainian territory.
*   Despite Ukraine's success, both Russia and some Western partners, including U.S. President Donald Trump, continue to underestimate it, with Trump claiming Ukraine has "no cards" and should accept a Kremlin-friendly peace deal.
*   The article concludes that the "human dimension"—Ukraine's skilled, inventive, and highly motivated personnel defending their homes—is the ultimate factor in Ukraine's military strength.

### Ukraine-Russia Peace Talks End Abruptly | TIME
**Source:** time.com, unknown

*   The second day of Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Geneva ended abruptly after just two hours, following a difficult first day of six-hour negotiations.
*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of "dragging out negotiations" that could have been finalized and said he tasked his delegation to make the talks productive.
*   After the talks ended, Zelensky reported over WhatsApp that progress had been made but "positions differ" because the negotiations were difficult. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umerov, described them as "intensive and substantive."
*   Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky called the talks "difficult, but businesslike" and stated "the next meeting will take place soon." U.S. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed "meaningful progress" and that another round of talks would occur.
*   The core stalemate revolves around Russia demanding Ukraine cede parts of the Donbas region it still controls, which Ukraine has repeatedly rejected.
*   Zelensky stated that Russia launched a missile strike on the same day the talks began, saying "this very clearly shows what Russia wants and what it is truly intent on," and urged U.S. officials to press Moscow to stop attacks.
*   Zelensky called it "not fair" for Trump to publicly call on Ukraine to make concessions for peace, but noted he had a respectful relationship with Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, adding "I am not a person who folds easily."
*   In the lead-up to the talks, Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine, saying "Ukraine better come to the table, fast" and that it would "miss a great opportunity" if it didn't move on a deal.
*   The talks come as Trump vowed to end the conflict on his first day back in office but has since walked back the "24-hour" timeline, though he still insists the war "will be ended."
*   Tensions between the Trump Administration and Ukraine have flared, including an Oval Office exchange where Vice President J.D. Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful, and Trump claimed Zelensky was "gambling with World War III."

### How big is the prize of reopening Russia?
**Source:** economist.com, 2026-02-17

*   Two parallel sets of talks are underway to end the war: American-led negotiations focusing on territory and security guarantees, and separate business-oriented talks.
*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing Ukrainian intelligence, claims Russia has promised deals worth $12 trillion to the U.S. in return for sanctions relief.
*   One insider source claims a sanctions relief package has already been agreed upon.
*   European leaders are growing concerned that President Donald Trump might pressure Ukraine into making "crippling concessions" by June—his latest deadline for peace—in order to secure the economic prize from Russia.

### Russia-Ukraine talks: All the mediation efforts, and where they stand | Explainer News | Al Jazeera
**Source:** aljazeera.com, 2026-02-18

*   U.S.-led peace talks in Geneva, mediated by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, ended early on February 14, 2026, with no breakthrough, as previous mediation attempts since the start of the war in 2022 have also failed.
*   During his 2024 campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly claimed he would broker a ceasefire in Ukraine within "24 hours," but this promise has not been fulfilled.
*   A timeline of key mediation efforts includes failed early talks in Belarus and Istanbul, the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July 2022, China's 12-point plan in 2023, an African leaders' 10-point plan, and the June 2024 Burgenstock Summit with over 90 participating nations (excluding Russia).
*   A major turning point occurred on February 28, 2025, when Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance had a televised, confrontational meeting with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office.
*   In August 2025, Trump envoy Witkoff met with Putin three times, and Trump himself met Putin in Alaska, but no concrete agreement emerged.
*   In November 2025, a controversial 28-point U.S. peace plan for Ukraine leaked, which reportedly included a cap on Ukraine's military, a freeze on NATO membership, and territorial concessions. The plan was met with accusations it was a "capitulation" for Ukraine and was rejected after revisions.
*   In December 2025, Zelenskyy met with U.S. and European leaders in Berlin, after which U.S. negotiators claimed 90% of issues between the sides had been resolved.
*   In January and February 2026, trilateral talks hosted by the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi resulted in an agreement to exchange 314 prisoners of war but left key political and security issues unresolved.
*   The current Geneva talks include senior military figures but have largely stalled due to Russia's insistence on keeping the territory it has seized from Ukraine.

### Ukraine’s patience with US peace push wears thin as Russia skirts pressure | Russia-Ukraine war News | Al Jazeera
**Source:** aljazeera.com, 2026-02-20

*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed frustration that U.S. pressure on peace talks was too "one-sided against Ukraine" and said the outcome was "not sufficient."
*   Zelenskyy stated that Ukrainians would "never forgive" the ceding of the remaining one-fifth of the Donetsk region to Russia, and said only 39% of surveyed Ukrainians accept the idea of transferring the region, even for strong security guarantees.
*   Two-thirds of Ukrainians surveyed do not believe the current U.S.-sponsored negotiations will lead to lasting peace. Zelenskyy favors freezing the current front line as a pretext for a ceasefire and future territorial negotiations.
*   While Trump claims Ukraine is holding up a peace deal, Zelenskyy called the public pressure "not fair" and expressed hope it was just his "tactics." U.S. senators visiting Ukraine agreed, saying Russia is not acting in "good faith" and that pressure on Moscow is key.
*   On the day of the Geneva talks, Russia launched a massive attack, including 396 attack drones and 29 missiles on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving 100,000 families without electricity and 3,500 buildings without heat in Kyiv.
*   Russia currently controls about 19% of Ukraine's territory, down from 26% in March 2022. Russia recently seized all of Luhansk but analysts doubt it can take the rest of Donetsk without serious losses.
*   Recent intelligence indicates Russia has lost access to Starlink terminals, which will likely take six months to replace, offering Ukraine a window to roll back Russian advances.
*   Ukraine claims its FPV drones are now responsible for 60% of all Russian casualties, and nine joint drone production facilities are planned in European countries, with the first opening in Germany on February 13.
*   At a Ramstein format meeting, Ukraine's European allies pledged 38 billion euros ($44.7 billion) in military aid this year, including 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for drones. The EU has also voted to borrow 90 billion euros ($106 billion) for Ukraine's financial aid.
