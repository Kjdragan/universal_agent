Additional meetings on Ukraine are possible, depending on developments on the ground.\n\nKey Recent Developments:\n\nOn 8 November, former US President Donald Trump was re-elected to the presidency, a development closely monitored by Kyiv due to its potentially significant impact on the conflict in Ukraine. As the US remains Ukraine's largest provider of military assistance, the election marked a critical juncture in shaping US foreign policy, with the leading candidates—Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris—articulating starkly divergent approaches to the ongoing conflict.\n\nPresident-elect Trump has repeatedly claimed that he could end the war in Ukraine \"in 24 hours\", although he has not provided specific details on how to achieve that goal. While Trump has criticised the scale of US military support to Ukraine, he has also suggested using such aid as leverage in peace talks. At an event in Florida on 14 November, Trump said that his administration will focus on the Russia-Ukraine war, emphasising the need for the war to stop.\n\nRussian officials have expressed optimism that Trump's re-election could provide an opportunity to reset US-Russia relations. During a 7 November meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based think tank and discussion forum, Russian President Vladimir Putin affirmed Moscow's willingness to explore the possibility of improving relations with the US. Putin also reiterated Russia's readiness for peace talks with Ukraine but argued that negotiations must be based on \"current realities\" on the ground.\n\nThe prospect of the US reducing or ceasing military support to Ukraine has raised concerns among European allies about the potential impact on Ukraine's defense capabilities and the broader implications for European security."

            "content": "For almost three years the Ukraine War has raged across the eastern and southern oblasts of the country as the Russian Federation continues its invasion. The invasion by Russian Federations Armed Forces (RFAF) began by assaulting Ukraine along five major axes with strikes at major city centers, including the capital in Kyiv. However, when the invasion stalled by the end of Spring 2022, RFAF had to transition from large-scale combat operations (LSCO) involving divisions and brigades to company and below assault forces predominantly in eastern and southern Ukraine, fully withdrawing from its northern axis along the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy oblasts. Simply put the Russian forces had failed to accurately assess the level of resistance, public support of Ukrainian resistance, and the strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) in relation not only to their own forces, but a more capable force than the army Russia had fought in the first Donbas War in 2013 through 2014.\n\nToday the RFAF continues to use small scale rifle actions between dismounted infantry forces assaulting adversarial fighting positions. Despite this reality, the forward line of own troops (FLOT) is anything but static as UAF and RFAF trade fighting positions weekly, if not daily, with Russia being primarily on the offensive. The exception being the UAFs incursion into Kursk which began in August 2024 and has seen the UAF transition primarily to the defensive as the RFAF have retaken more than half of the territory that was originally seized.\n\nThis analysis examines the historical context of armor losses, the shifting tactics employed by both sides, and the strategic paralysis that has emerged as a result of the prolonged conflict."
