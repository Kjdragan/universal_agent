**Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov continue to publicly demonstrate their commitment to achieving Russia’s original war aims while exaggerating Russian battlefield gains.** Putin stated during a December 17 ceremony awarding medals to Russian servicemembers that Russia will achieve all of its goals and claimed that Russian forces have seized “strategically important settlements” that are opening up opportunities for further offensives.[1] The Kremlin readout from the event highlighted statements from a recipient of the Hero of Russia award, who stated that Russian forces are fulfilling Putin’s mandate to seize Russia’s “ancestral lands.” Putin’s December 17 statements are in line with his other recent statements, indicating his commitment to his 2022 maximalist war aims, such that he will not be satisfied with a peace agreement based on the US-proposed 28-point plan.[2]
Putin continued to exaggerate Russian successes, alleging that Russian forces had seized Siversk.[3] ISW has only observed evidence to assess that Russian forces have seized about 77 percent of Siversk. Gerasimov also claimed during a December 18 briefing for foreign military attachés that Russian forces have seized Kupyansk (despite mounting evidence of Ukrainian forces liberating a significant portion of the town) and control 50 percent of Kostyantynivka.[4] ISW has not observed evidence or even claims of Russian advances in Kostyantynivka close to Gerasimov’s figure. ISW has observed evidence that Russian forces have seized only 1.6 percent of Kostyantynivka, while maintaining a presence within only five percent of the town (either through infiltration missions or assaults). Even Russian milbloggers’ maximalist claims about Russian advances are not as extensive as Gerasimov’s, with milbloggers claiming that Russian forces have seized only about 11 percent of the town.
Gerasimov further claimed that Russian forces have seized over 6,300 square kilometers in 2025 — slightly more than Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov’s December 17 claim of 6,000 square kilometers.[5] ISW assesses that Russian forces have seized only about 4,700 square kilometers in 2025, but even Gerasimov’s more exaggerated claim only amounts to an area slightly larger than the state of Delaware or just 1.04 percent of Ukraine’s total land area. Gerasimov’s and Belousov’s exaggerated claims actually demonstrate the slow pace of Russian advances and undermine the Kremlin’s ongoing cognitive warfare effort to portray a Russian battlefield victory in Ukraine and the collapse of Ukrainian defenses as inevitable.[6] Gerasimov used his briefing to foreign military officials to repeat many of the claims from Putin’s and Belousov’s addresses to the December 17 Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) board meeting, likely in order to spread these Russian narratives to an international audience.
**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to signal his commitment to negotiations as high-ranking Kremlin officials continue to publicly and explicitly reject significant points of the peace plan currently under discussion.** Zelensky reiterated on December 18 his readiness to hold presidential elections in Ukraine as a step toward a peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine — in line with the initial US-proposed 28-point plan requiring that Ukraine hold elections within 100 days of codifying the agreement. Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated on December 18 that Russia continues to see the deployment of any Western troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees for post-war Ukraine “unacceptable” and that Russia would see such troops as “legitimate.”[7] The Kremlin has repeatedly voiced its unwillingness to agree to any meaningful security guarantees for Ukraine, likely to allow Russia to renew its aggression against Ukraine after a peace to achieve Putin’s maximalist war aim of gaining full effective control over Ukraine. Zelensky has, in stark contrast, demonstrated Ukraine’s willingness to make meaningful compromises.[8] Kremlin officials have repeatedly rejected elements of the 28-point plan, calling into question Putin’s willingness to accept even that outline agreement and demonstrating how essential a reliable security guarantee for Ukraine will be for the sustainability of any peace agreement.
**Three Russian border guards briefly crossed into Estonian territory on December 17.** Estonian authorities reported that the Russian border guards used a hovercraft to access the Vasknarva stone breakwater on the Narva River, which is situated in both Russian and Estonian territory.[9] The border guards reportedly disembarked the hovercraft, walked a short distance along the breakwater into Estonian territory, and subsequently returned to Russian territory shortly thereafter.[10] Estonian Interior Minister Igor Taro stated on December 17 that the border guards crossed into Estonian territory in an area where Russian vessels must request access in order to pass into Estonian territory — a process to which Taro noted Russian authorities have long adhered.[11] Taro stated that Estonian authorities have not determined the motive behind the border crossing. Estonian border guards observed seven armed Russian servicemembers, who were wearing uniforms that suggested they were not Russian border guards, operating near the Russia-Estonia border on October 10, but the Russian personnel did not enter Estonian territory in that incident.[12] ISW continues to assess that Russia is intensifying its covert and overt attacks against Europe and that Russia has entered “Phase Zero” — the informational and psychological condition setting phase — to prepare for a possible NATO-Russia war in the future.[13]The December 17 event is the first instance ISW has observed of uniformed Russian personnel crossing over into NATO territory since the start of Russia’s Phase Zero effort in September 2025.

**_We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._**

The officer of a Ukrainian brigade operating in the Kupyansk direction reported on December 17 that Russian forces have intensified rocket and glide bomb strikes against Ukrainian positions in Kupyansk after recent Ukrainian advances in the town.[28] The officer stated that Russian forces are striking indiscriminately at any targets that could be Ukrainian fortifications. The officer stated that Russian forces are likely striking Kupyansk-Vuzlovyi (south of Kupyansk) to support future use of the railway in the settlement and shore up logistics routes for future offensives.
A Ukrainian brigade published footage on December 17 showing Ukrainian forces repelling a platoon-sized Russian mechanized assault in the Kupyansk direction, possibly north of Petropavlivka.[29] Ukrainian forces destroyed one Russian BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), two BTR-80 armored personnel carriers (APCs), two buggies, nine motorcycles, and three quad bikes during the assault.
A Kremlin-affiliated milblogger criticized the Russian MoD on December 17 for spreading footage of Russian servicemembers purportedly in Kupyansk to support the MoD’s claim that Russian forces control Kupyansk, as the video was later geolocated to Tavolzhanka, approximately 20 kilometers northeast of Kupyansk.[30] The milblogger noted that exaggerated claims of control are harmful and are contributing to unnecessary Russian personnel losses.
