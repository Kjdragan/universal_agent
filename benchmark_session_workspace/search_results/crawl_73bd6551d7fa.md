**US delegations met separately with a Ukrainian-European delegation and a Russian delegation in Miami on December 19 and 20, respectively.** US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and former Senior Advisor to the US President Jared Kushner met with Ukrainian Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov and Ukrainian Chief of the General Staff Major General Andriy Hnatov on December 19, and Umerov stated that European representatives also joined the talks at the invitation of the United States.[1] Axios correspondent Barak Ravid reported on December 19 that two unspecified sources stated that national security advisors from Germany, France, and the UK joined the US-Ukrainian talks on December 19.[2] Ravid stated that Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani joined the December 19 talks. Lead Russian negotiator and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) CEO Kirill Dmitriev arrived in Miami on December 20 to meet with Witkoff and Kushner.[3] Reuters reported that a Russian source stated that there would not be a meeting between Dmitriev and the Ukrainian delegation.[4]
**US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated that both Russia and Ukraine must make compromises to end the war after Russian President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to his full war aims on December 19.** Rubio noted on December 19 that Ukrainian-Russian negotiations to end the war will require that both sides “give something” and that the United States is trying to figure out “what both sides are prepared to give.”[5] Putin used his December 19 Direct Line televised press conference to outline his demands for a future peace settlement — the same demands with which he launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022.[6] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in contrast, reiterated on December 20 his readiness to hold presidential elections in Ukraine as a step toward ending Russia’s war. Zelensky stated that he is ready to hold elections in Ukraine if conditions are in place for Ukrainian authorities to ensure “proper, decent, and democratic elections.”[7] Zelensky stated that the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is working to prepare and ensure the necessary infrastructure to hold elections abroad, as the number of Ukrainian citizens living abroad has grown.[8] Zelensky noted that the Ukrainian military must be able to participate in the elections and that there must be international observers and a ceasefire, even if a temporary one, to hold elections. Russia’s unwillingness to engage in good-faith negotiations and compromise from its demands for Ukraine’s full capitulation continues to demonstrate the need for robust security guarantees to ensure that any future agreement produces a sustainable peace and prevent renewed Russian aggression. The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected such security guarantees, however.[9]
**Ukrainian forces struck Russian military and oil assets overnight on December 19 to 20.** Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) reported that SBU forces struck two Russian Su-27 fighter jets at the Belbek Airbase near occupied Sevastopol, Crimea, overnight.[10] The SBU reported that one of the aircraft was carrying ammunition and taxiing for a combat mission at the time of the strike, which destroyed the aircraft. The SBU published geolocated footage showing Ukrainian drones hitting the Su-27s.[11] Ukrainian forces struck long-range radar systems, air defense systems, and a MiG-31 interceptor aircraft at the Belbek Airbase overnight on December 17 to 18.[12] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces struck a Russian RSP-6M2 radar system overnight on December 19 to 20, which Russian forces used to assist aircraft landing in poor visibility, near occupied Krasnosilske, Crimea.[13] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that several Ukrainian drones also struck a Project 22460 Okhotnik-class patrol boat patrolling near an oil and gas field and a drilling rig in the Filanovsky oil field in the Caspian Sea and that Ukraine is conducting a battle damage assessment.[14] A Ukrainian open-source intelligence (OSINT) project assessed that Ukrainian forces used FP-2 long range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and likely struck the patrol boat.[15] Ukrainian forces have struck oil infrastructure at the Filanovsky oil field three times since December 10.[16]
**Three drones — at least two of which are reportedly Russian drone models — have entered Turkish airspace or crashed into Turkey since December 15.** The Turkish Ministry of National Defense reported on December 15 that Turkish and NATO forces shot down a drone approaching Turkish airspace from the Black Sea.[17] Turkish authorities did not specify the type or origin of the drone. The Turkish Interior Ministry reported on December 19 that Turkish authorities found a downed Russian Orlan-10 reconnaissance drone near Izmit in northwestern Turkey.[18] Turkish outlets reported on December 20 that a third drone crashed in Balıkesir Province in northwestern Turkey, possibly on an earlier date, and that there were no identifying markings on the drone.[19] A Russian milblogger claimed that the third drone was a Russian Merlin-VR reconnaissance drone.[20] Turkish authorities have not directly attributed the incidents to Russia as of this writing. ISW continues to assess that Russia is intensifying its covert and overt attacks against Europe and that Russia has entered “Phase Zero” — the informational and psychological condition setting phase — to prepare for a possible NATO-Russia war in the future.[21]

**_We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._**
**Ukrainian forces may have struck a Russian ammunition depot in Bryansk Oblast on the night of December 19 to 20.** Russian opposition outlet Astra reported on December 20 that locals reported fires and audible explosions in Novozybkov, Bryansk Oblast.[22] Open-source analysts on X (formerly Twitter) geolocated the footage and assessed that the explosions may have occurred at an ammunition depot in the area.[23]

#### **Russian objective: Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and encircle northern Donetsk Oblast**
Assessed Ukrainian advance: Geolocated footage published on December 20 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently advanced along the P-79 Kupyansk-Chuhuiv highway in central Kupyansk.[38]
Russian forces attacked near Kupyansk itself, east of Kupyansk toward Petropavlivka, southeast of Kupyansk near Stepova Novoselivka and Pishchane, and south of Kupyansk near Kupyansk-Vuzlovyi on December 19 and 20.[39] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces counterattacked from Sobolivka (west of Kupyansk) and Myrove (northwest of Kupyansk), within Kupyansk, and near Stepova Novoselivka.[40]

The Ukrainian 7th Army Corps reported on December 20 that Russian forces are using the Serebryanske forest area to accumulate manpower, establish forward positions for drone operators, and conduct assaults toward Serebryanka and Dronivka.[51] ISW has previously assessed that Russian fiber optic drone innovations solved issues with foliage blocking radio signals of regular drones, allowing Russian forces to eventually consolidate within and use the Serebryanske forest area more actively.[52] The 7th Army Corps reported that Ukrainian forces still hold positions in Dronivka and are repelling Russian attempts to infiltrate into Dronivka.[53] The corps reported that Russian forces primarily operate in small groups camouflaged with ghillie suits and thermal cloaks to identify weak points in Ukrainian positions. The corps noted that the key Russian objective in the area is to infiltrate Zakitne (northwest of Siversk) and consolidate on the dominant heights. The spokesperson of a Ukrainian brigade operating in the Siversk direction reported on December 19 that Russian drone operators established positions in multi-story buildings within Siversk, allowing Russian forces to exercise fire control over Siversk and disrupt Ukrainian logistics and defensive lines in the area.[54]
**Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area on December 20 but did not make confirmed advances.**

**Ukrainian forces recently advanced or maintained positions in the Pokrovsk direction.**
Assessed Russian infiltrations: Geolocated footage published on December 20 shows two Russian servicemembers raising a Russian flag in southwestern Svitle (northeast of Pokrovsk).[67] Additional geolocated footage published on December 20 shows Ukrainian forces striking Russian servicemembers along the Donetska railway south of Hryshyne (northwest of Pokrovsk).[68] ISW assesses that these were Russian infiltration missions that did not change the control of terrain or forward edge of the battle area (FEBA) at this time.
Unconfirmed claims: The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces seized Svitle.[69] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces advanced in northern Myrnohrad (east of Pokrovsk).[70] One Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces seized Myrnohrad.[71] Other Russian milbloggers criticized the claim of the seizure of Myrnohrad as premature, stating that Russian forces have only seized half of the town and that Ukrainian forces maintain a presence in the northern part.[72]
Refinement of area under Russian claims: Geolocated footage published on December 20 shows Russian forces conducting multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) strikes against a Ukrainian-occupied building in northern Myrnohrad — an area where Russian sources previously claimed Russian forces maintained a presence.[73]
Russian forces attacked near and within Pokrovsk itself; north of Pokrovsk near Rodynske; northeast of Pokrovsk near Svitle; east of Pokrovsk near Myrnohrad; southwest of Pokrovsk near Zvirove, Kotlyne, Udachne, Molodetske, and Novopidhorodne; and northwest of Pokrovsk near Hryshyne on December 19 and 20.[74] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces counterattacked northwest of Pokrovsk and near Myrnohrad and Hryshyne.[75]
The deputy commander of a Ukrainian battalion operating in the Pokrovsk direction stated that small Russian groups are conducting assaults and infiltration missions daily.[76] The commander stated that Russian forces shift to striking Ukrainian firing points and drone pilot positions if assaults are unsuccessful. The commander noted that Russian strikes against drone pilot positions that destroy equipment cause problems because Ukrainian forces cannot store spare equipment at the position. The commander stated that Russian guided glide bomb strikes are accurate but that Russian forces do not conduct these strikes often.
Order of Battle: Elements of the Russian 506th Motorized Rifle Regiment (27th Motorized Rifle Division, 2nd CAA, Central Military District [CMD]) and 30th Motorized Rifle Brigade (2nd CAA) are reportedly operating north of Pokrovsk.[77] First-person view (FPV) drone operators of the 238th Artillery Brigade (8th CAA) are reportedly striking Ukrainian unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) near Myrnohrad.[78] Drone operators of the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade (51st CAA) are reportedly striking Ukrainian forces in the Pokrovsk direction.[79] Buk-M2 crews of the 297th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade (2nd CAA) are reportedly downing Ukrainian High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) rockets in the Pokrovsk direction.[80]

Assessed Russian advances: Geolocated footage published on December 19 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced in central Dobropillya and Varvarivka (both north of Hulyaipole) and east of both settlements.[85]
Assessed Russian infiltrations: Geolocated footage published on December 19 shows Russian forces operating in central Hulyaipole during what ISW assesses was a Russian infiltration mission that did not change control of terrain or the forward edge of the battle area (FEBA).[86] Available video evidence shows a continued Ukrainian presence in central Hulyaipole.[87] The available evidence about the situation in central Hulyaipole suggests that the Russian and Ukrainian positions are intermixed in central Hulyaipole.
Refinement of area under Russian claims: Geolocated footage published on December 19 shows Ukrainian servicemembers capturing Russian personnel and operating in central and southern Dobropillya (north of Hulyaipole) and south of the settlement — areas where Russian sources previously claimed that Russian forces maintained a presence.[88]

**Ukrainian forces recently advanced or maintained positions in western Zaporizhia Oblast.**
Unconfirmed claims: Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces seized Stepnohirsk (west of Orikhiv) but that limited Ukrainian groups are still present in central Stepnohirsk.[94] One milblogger claimed that Russian forces have seized most but not all of the settlement.[95] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces also advanced southwest of Lukyanivske (northwest of Orikhiv).[96]
Refinement of areas on Russian claims: Geolocated footage published on December 20 shows Russian forces striking a Ukrainian-occupied building in central Prymorske (west of Orikhiv) – an area where Russian sources previously claimed that Russian forces maintained a presence.[97]
