**Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly and explicitly outlined his continued commitment to his maximalist war aims in Ukraine — the same aims for which Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.** Putin spoke on December 17 to an expanded meeting of the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) board, where he claimed that Russia will “undoubtedly” achieve its war goals in Ukraine.[1] Putin claimed that Russia would prefer to use diplomatic means to achieve its war goals and address the alleged “root causes” of the war (a term that the Kremlin has long used as shorthand to mean its original war justifications and demands). Russian State Duma Defense Committee Member Andrei Kolesnik similarly noted on December 17 that Russia’s goal remains to eliminate the root causes of the war, which Kolesnik stated “means the demilitarization [and] denazification” of Ukraine — a reference to Russia’s original aims of severely limiting the Ukrainian military such that Ukraine cannot defend itself, the removal of the current Ukrainian government, and the installation of a pro-Russian puppet government in its place.[2]
Putin also reiterated Russia’s commitment to eventually achieving its wider territorial aims in Ukraine, claiming that Russia will “liberat[e] its historical lands” through military means if Ukraine and the West “refuse to engage in substantive discussions.”[3] Kremlin officials, including Putin, have repeatedly referred to wide expanses of Ukrainian territory beyond the four oblasts that Russia has illegally annexed as “historical” and “Russian” territory. Kremlin officials have often labelled Odesa City as a “Russian” city and discussed “Novorossiya” — an amorphous invented region in southern and eastern Ukraine that the Kremlin has claimed is “integral” to Russia, and that covers territory beyond the five regions that Russia has illegally annexed.[4] The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected US- and Ukrainian-proposed peace plans while trying to shift the blame for the lack of progress in negotiations onto Ukraine.[5] Putin’s claim about seizing Russia’s “historical” territories if Ukraine and the West refuse to engage in negotiations likely aims to put the responsibility on continued Russian efforts to achieve Putin’s original war aims on Ukraine — not Russia.
**Putin’s statements continue to demonstrate that he will not be satisfied with a peace agreement based on the US-proposed 28-point peace plan.** The Kremlin has not publicly and explicitly stated that it would accept the 28-point plan or any subsequent versions, but rather has been rejecting many points of the plan in recent weeks.[6] The statements by Putin and other Kremlin officials make clear that Putin has no intention of giving up his maximalist objectives in Ukraine and will seek to pursue them after any suspension of hostilities on conditions short of those objectives. The repeated Kremlin statements contradicting elements of the 28-point plan call into question Putin’s willingness to accept even that outline agreement and demonstrate how essential a reliable security guarantee for Ukraine will be to the durability of any agreement.
The 28-point plan called for Russia to relinquish the territory it controls outside of occupied Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts and for the frontline in Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts to freeze.[7] Putin and Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov indicated during the Russian MoD board meeting that Russia will not be satisfied with those lines. Putin noted that Russian forces are creating and expanding “buffer zones” in Ukraine.[8] Belousov continued to claim that Russian forces have seized Kupyansk — despite evidence of Ukrainian forces liberating a significant portion of the town.[9] Belousov claimed that the alleged seizure of Kupyansk will expand Russia’s buffer zone in Kharkiv Oblast, thereby reducing the threat of Ukrainian shelling against northern areas of occupied Luhansk Oblast. Putin similarly tasked Russian forces with creating a buffer zone in northern Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts in the past, and the Kremlin is likely also to demand cede some of this territory due to Russia’s alleged need for a buffer zone.[10] Belousov highlighted Russia’s commitment to achieving control of all of Zaporizhia Oblast, claiming that ongoing Russian efforts to seize Hulyaipole and Orikhiv will “pave the way” for the seizure of the entire oblast.
**Robust security guarantees for Ukraine are essential to ensure that any future agreement produces a sustainable peace, but the Kremlin has been publicly rejecting the idea of such guarantees.**[11] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on December 17, for example, that Russia’s position on foreign military contingents operating on Ukrainian territory is well known, consistent, and clear, and Kolesnik stated that Russia will not tolerate European security guarantees with troop deployments to Ukraine.[12] The Kremlin is likely seeking a peace agreement without security guarantees in order to set conditions for Russia to renew its aggression against Ukraine in the future, in order to achieve Putin’s maximalist war aim of gaining full effective control over Ukraine.
**Belousov used Russia’s seizure of small- and medium-sized settlements to support false Russia claims that Russian forces can rapidly seize the significantly larger population centers comprising Ukraine’s Fortress Belt.** Belousov falsely claimed that the collapse of Ukrainian defenses is “inevitable,” continuing extensive Kremlin cognitive warfare efforts that aim to portray a Russian battlefield victory as inevitable in order to influence ongoing peace negotiations.[13] Belousov claimed that Russian forces are fighting within Kostyantynivka, which Belousov stated is “key” to seizing Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, and Slovyansk — major cities that make up the heavily fortified Fortress Belt that serves as the backbone of Ukraine’s defense in Donetsk Oblast. Belousov highlighted Russia’s seizure of small- and medium-sized settlements, such as Chasiv Yar, Kurakhove, and Mala Tokmachka. Belousov also claimed that Russian forces seized Siversk and Pokrovsk (which ISW has not observed evidence to confirm) and noted that Russian forces are currently trying to seize Hulyaipole and Lyman. Russian forces have often spent months trying to seize these small- and medium-sized settlements and have notably been fighting within Pokrovsk itself for almost 140 days.[14]
The cities in Ukraine’s Fortress Belt are significantly larger than the small- and medium-sized settlements that Belousov highlighted. Kurakhove is only about seven square kilometers in size and had a pre-war population of only 5,000. Siversk and Chasiv Yar are both about 10 square kilometers with pre-war populations of about 11,000 to 12,000.
Pokrovsk, which Russian forces have been trying to take for nearly two years, is about 23 square kilometers with a pre-war population of 60,000. Kostyantynivka has an area of 33 square kilometers and a pre-war population of 67,000. Druzhkivka is 23 square kilometers with a pre-war population of 54,000. Kramatorsk is 48 square kilometers with a pre-war population of 147,000. Slovyansk is 63 square kilometers with a pre-war population of 105,000. Belousov is attempting to present Russia’s seizure of much smaller settlements as evidence of Russia’s ability to rapidly seize the much larger cities in the Fortress Belt, but battlefield realities indicate otherwise.
Belousov claimed that Russian forces have seized 6,000 square kilometers along the entire frontline during 2025 — an area smaller than the US state of Delaware and just under one percent of Ukraine’s total land area.[15] ISW assesses that Russian forces have seized only 4,699.04 square kilometers in 2025 — an area slightly larger than the size of Rhode Island.[16] Even Belousov’s exaggerated claims about Russian advances demonstrate the slow pace of those advances. Belousov claimed that the Russian seizure of the Fortress Belt will enable Russian forces to “quickly” seize the remainder of Donetsk Oblast, but his statements about Russian advances in 2025 are actually in line with ISW’s assessment that it will take Russian forces two or more years to seize the remainder of Donetsk Oblast at great cost.[17]
**Belousov’s comments demonstrate that Russian forces are optimizing themselves for positional warfare in Ukraine — not for the mechanized maneuver required to make rapid, large-scale gains.** Belousov laid out a series of technological and tactical adaptations that Russian forces have made on the battlefield in the last year, including the increased use of drones for reconnaissance and fire missions, the effectiveness of the Russian Rubikon Center for Advanced Unmanned Technologies, the reliance on all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and motorcycles to quickly traverse the “kill zone” in the face of drones, and the increased use of trench-based electronic warfare (EW) systems.[18] Many of these Russian adaptations actually demonstrate how the Russian military has optimized itself for positional warfare in Ukraine rather than preparing to resume fast paced mechanized maneuver in Ukraine — as ISW recently assessed.[19] Belousov’s statements further show that the Russian MoD does not expect the character of the war to quickly change but is preparing rather to continue positional warfare and slow grinding advances. Russian forces have developed a minimally sufficient operational technique that can enable very slow operational successes, but this approach does not translate effectively to maneuver warfare on a wide scale and will not allow Russian forces to rapidly collapse Ukrainian defenses in the short- to medium-term.[20]
Belousov claimed that nearly 410,000 Russians have signed contracts with the Russian MoD since the beginning of 2025 — 8,200 per week or 32,800 per month.[21] Data from the Ukrainian General Staff on Russian losses indicate that Russian forces suffered an average of 34,600 casualties per month between January and November 2025 — suggesting that Belousov’s recruitment numbers are not quite replacing Russian losses. Belousov’s claimed figure is likely exaggerated, as Russian opposition media investigations examining Russian federal budget expenditures on payouts to new recruits have recently shown.[22] The Kremlin’s ongoing efforts to mobilize reservists for likely deployment to Ukraine in the future further indicate that Russia cannot meet its force generation requirements through the ongoing system that uses high financial incentives to recruit volunteers due to a lack of volunteers, a lack of resources to fund the payouts, or both.[23] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin’s efforts to deploy reservists to Ukraine are a domestically risky policy threatening to break the Kremlin’s ongoing social contract with the population, and the Kremlin would likely not pursue this force generation method unless necessary. Belousov is likely inflating the recruitment numbers to quell domestic worries about compulsory reserve mobilization.
**Putin and Belousov highlighted Russian military and nuclear strength while threatening Europe.** Putin claimed that it is “nonsense” that Russia poses a threat to Europe and that NATO, rather, is threatening Russia by preparing for a future confrontation.[24] Putin and Belousov simultaneously spotlighted Russia’s military expansion efforts, strategic nuclear forces, and new weapons systems, such as the Burevestnik missile and Poseidon unmanned underwater vehicle. Belousov claimed that Ukraine and the West are trying to prolong the war in order to weaken Russia and that NATO policies to prepare for a future war have created “preconditions” for Russia’s continued military action into 2026. Belousov stated that Russia must therefore continue to impose its will on its “enemy,” act preemptively, and refine its warfighting methods and techniques. Kolesnik also claimed on December 17 that Europe is playing “Russian roulette,” which Russians “have always won,” by supporting Ukraine.[25] Kolesnik claimed that Russia should show Germany the Soviet Victory Banner from the Second World War more often and that Germany should “think about Germany’s future.” Belousov’s false claims that Ukrainian defenses are on the brink of collapse are incongruous with Russia’s large-scale military expansion and weapons development efforts — if Ukraine is about to collapse, then the continued military mobilization of Russia should be unnecessary. ISW continues to assess that Russia’s ongoing military reforms and expansion efforts reflect the reality that Russia is in no position to defeat Ukraine rapidly and are also part of preparation for a potential conflict with NATO in the future.[26]

Order of Battle: Drone operators of the Russian 4th Military Base (58th CAA, Southern Military District [SMD]) and Phoenix drone crews (likely part of BARS-Sarmat Unmanned Systems Special Purpose Center [formerly BARS-Sarmat Detachment, subordinated to Airborne Forces]) are reportedly operating near Orikhiv.[83] Drone operators of the 108th Airborne (VDV) Regiment (7th VDV Division) reportedly continue to operate in the Zaporizhia direction.[84]
**Neither Ukrainian nor Russian sources reported ground activity in the Kherson direction on December 17.**
Order of Battle: Elements of the Russian 98th VDV Division reportedly continue to operate in the Kherson direction.[85]
#### **Russian Objective: Target Ukrainian military and civilian infrastructure in the rear and on the front line**
**Russian forces conducted a series of drone strikes against Ukraine on the night of December 16 to 17.** The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russian forces launched 69 Shahed-type, Gerbera-type, and other drones — of which roughly 40 were Shahed-type drones — from the directions of Kursk and Oryol cities; Millerovo, Rostov Oblast; Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Krasnodar Krai; and occupied Hvardiiske, Crimea.[86] The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Ukrainian forces downed 37 drones and that 29 drones struck 12 locations.[87] Ukrainian officials reported that Russian forces struck civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Odesa oblasts.[88] Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov claimed on December 17 that Russian strikes have disabled over 70 percent of Ukraine’s thermal power plants and 37 percent of Ukraine’s hydroelectric power plants.[89] ISW continues to assess that Russia’s intensified strike campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is a concerted Russian effort to degrade Ukraine’s energy security and industrial capacity and demoralize the Ukrainian populace.[90]
#### **Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks**
Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko endorsed the Russian occupation of Crimea on December 16 and falsely claimed that Ukraine allowed the Russian occupation of Crimea to happen unopposed.[91] Lukashenko further claimed that Ukraine will continue the war if the West does not force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the peace table.[92]
