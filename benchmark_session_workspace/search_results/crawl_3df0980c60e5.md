  * We will be closing the live page soon. Here’s a review of the day’s main events:
    * A group of 27 European leaders convened in the Belgian capital, Brussels, to discuss the war in Ukraine and whether or not to seize nearly $200bn worth of and divert them to Ukraine, a measure that has prompted concerns about legal questions and possible Russian retaliation by some EU countries.
    * Negotiations dragged on all day and into the evening, with no official decision forthcoming by press time.
    * Odesa governor Oleh Kiper said that a woman was killed and her three children injured in a Russian drone strike in Odesa, where Russian attacks have damaged infrastructure and caused power outages in recent days.
    * EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged support for the measure, saying that further pressure is necessary until Russia is willing to “seriously talk about peace”.
    * US President said that he hopes Ukraine will “move quickly” to reach an agreement on ending the war with Russia, as Russian and US officials are expected to meet this weekend in Miami.
  * Ukraine’s Economy Ministry has said that a critical minerals deal with the US will take effect early in 2026.
“We are now moving from paperwork to reconstruction, developing a high-quality pipeline to deploy capital into projects that support Ukraine’s long-term growth and supply chain resilience,” Oleksii Sobolev, Ukraine’s economy minister, is quoted as saying in a report by the Ukrainian news agency Kyiv Independent.
  * Andrii Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, says the UN General Assembly resolution “strongly condemns Russia’s aggression, reaffirms Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and demands an immediate end to the war and withdrawal of Russian forces”.
Sybiha said the measure, which concerns Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine, including Crimea and Sevastopol, has been initiated annually by Kyiv since 2016.
“The resolution strengthens international monitoring of grave human rights and humanitarian law violations and underscores the imperative of accountability,” he wrote on X.
  * ## Russian general says country will take ‘appropriate’ measures if US resumes nuclear testing
Army General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, has said that Russia is committed to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty but will take “appropriate retaliatory measures” if the US follows through on plans to resume nuclear weapons testing.
The Russian news service TASS also reported that Gerasimov told a group of foreign military attaches that NATO members have “significantly increased” military forces near Russia’s borders, posing a “long-term challenge” to the country’s security.
Speaking about the state of Russia’s war on Ukraine, he said that Moscow is “up against the economic and military might of the collective West” but maintains the “strategic initiative” in the war.
  * That’s according to political risk analyst Ben Godwin, who says despite diplomatic engagement and growing pressure for a peace settlement, talks remain stalled as Ukraine opposes territorial concessions.

  * As we reported earlier, Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister held talks with a Chinese Foreign Ministry official in Beijing today in a rare, in-person meeting between the two governments.
China has been accused of aiding Russia to prolong its war against Ukraine, straining Beijing-Kyiv ties.
At the same time, Beijing is one of Kyiv’s most crucial trading partners – and experts have said the Ukrainian government should work to mend the relationship.

  * ## Chances of a deal appear ‘less optimistic’ as Brussels talks stretch on
Negotiations have now gone way into the evening, and that’s not unusual for the European Union.
But they knew that this [meeting] would be particular hard because using these frozen Russian assets – billions of dollars – is considered tricky, risky and also unprecedented.
What we are hearing is that since this morning most of the negotiations have been happening on the sidelines of the main conference.
There’s been a lot of bilateral talks on the sidelines. New drafts have been written and are being written as we speak. There are a lot of changes and a lot of going back and forth.
They were quite optimistic before that there would be a deal maybe in the early morning here, or this evening. But now it looks slightly less optimistic.
  * ## What steps could Russia take if frozen assets are seized?
Russia’s Central Bank has said that it will take steps to counter the seizure of frozen assets that European countries are contemplating putting to use on behalf of Ukraine, despite strong protests from Moscow that the move would be illegal.
The bank filed a complaint last week in a Moscow Arbitration Court, but it is not clear how it would enforce a ruling in its favour or collect any potential damages.
The EU banned the enforcement of Russian court orders regarding frozen assets more than 10 years ago, but the prime minister of Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, has raised concerns about potential liability due to a 1989 treaty, or retaliation from Moscow.
