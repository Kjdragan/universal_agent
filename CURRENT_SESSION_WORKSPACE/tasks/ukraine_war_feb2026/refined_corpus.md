### Power drought tips Ukraine's economy into worst crisis since war's first year | Reuters
**Source:** reuters.com, February 23, 2026

- Ukraine is enduring its most severe economic crisis since early 2022 due to sustained Russian air strikes that have left the power system in tatters as the war enters its fifth year.
- A survey by the European Business Association indicates 80% of firms have been affected by electricity outages, with 50% reducing output and 61% reporting rising costs.
- Sergii Pylypenko, CEO of Kovalska Group (Ukraine's largest building materials producer), stated that emergency power cuts have lasted over two months without a predictable schedule, reducing production volumes by up to 50% at certain times because diesel generators cannot power full factory output.
- The economy shrank by nearly one-third in the first year of the war; while modest growth occurred subsequently, nearly 6 million people have left Ukraine and more than 3 million are internally displaced (over a fifth of the pre-war population).
- In February, the Institute for Economic Research's monthly business activity recovery index turned negative for the first time since 2023.
- Nataliia Kolesnichenko (Centre for Economic Studies in Kyiv) estimated energy demand exceeded supply by 30% in January and February.
- Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal reported peak demand at 16.4 gigawatts against a domestic production capacity of 12.3 gigawatts, necessitating imports of almost 2 gigawatts at peak times.
- The central bank cut its 2026 economic growth forecast to 1.8% from 2%. Independent forecasts are more pessimistic: Dragon Capital predicts 1% growth, while ICU downgraded its forecast to 0.8% (noting 20-25% of output relies on steady electricity).
- Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko stated the energy crisis cost the state budget 12 billion hryvnias ($280 million) in customs and tax revenues in January alone.
- Ukraine's debt has jumped to almost 100% of GDP despite two restructurings; Ukraine is close to securing a new $8.1 billion IMF lending program after the IMF agreed to ease conditions.
- IMF approval is expected to unlock approximately 90 billion euros ($105 billion) in EU assistance over two years, a lifeline after the Trump administration stopped direct U.S. budget aid.
- Hungary and Slovakia, which accounted for 68% of Ukraine's imported power this month (per ExPro), have threatened to halt power exports unless Russia's Druzhba pipeline oil flows resume.
- Global steelmaker ArcelorMittal lost around 10% of hot metal production and more than 25% of finished rolled products in January due to electricity shortages, suspending a continuous casting machine to prevent equipment damage.

### After four years of Russia's invasion, time to stop underestimating Ukraine - Atlantic Council
**Source:** atlanticcouncil.org, February 18, 2026

- Russia's full-scale invasion has lasted longer than the entire conflict between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in WWII; Putin initially expected a brief campaign to decapitate the state with ~200,000 troops, even bringing parade uniforms for a quick victory.
- The Russian blitzkrieg failed due to false assumptions that Ukraine was an artificial state with no unifying identity and that its military could not wage modern war, ignoring Ukraine's post-2014 military reforms.
- By the end of 2022, Ukraine had liberated half the land Russia seized in the initial invasion; subsequently, Kyiv has decimated the Russian Black Sea Fleet and launched long-range strikes deep inside Russia.
- The nature of the war has shifted from tanks and artillery in 2022 to a war of attrition dominated by drones and small infantry groups, creating a "kill zone" of at least ten kilometers from the front line.
- Ukraine has developed a large, sophisticated domestic drone industry to compensate for reduced U.S. aid under the Trump administration, positioning itself at the cutting edge of defense tech; Ukrainian soldiers now train NATO counterparts in drone warfare.
- While Moscow has held the battlefield initiative since late 2023, the Russian army has captured only about 1% of additional Ukrainian territory while suffering hundreds of thousands of casualties.
- Putin was exposed exaggerating advances in late 2025 when he claimed to have captured Kupyansk, only for President Zelenskyy to visit the city personally and record a video refuting the claim.
- Both Russia and some Western partners (including President Trump, who claims Ukraine has "no cards") continue to underestimate Ukraine's resilience and military capability.
- The article argues that Ukraine holds multiple "trump cards," specifically the human dimension—skilled, inventive, and highly motivated personnel defending their homes—which remains the ultimate determinant of battlefield outcomes.

**Source:** commonslibrary.parliament.uk, Date unknown (Updated Feb 2026)

- Since Russia's invasion in February 2022, over 14,999 civilians have been killed (a likely underestimate per UN monitors) and 10.8 million people (out of an estimated population of 33 million) require humanitarian assistance in 2026.
- Approximately 5.9 million refugees from Ukraine are recorded globally; Germany hosts the most (1.3 million), followed by Russia (1.2 million) and Poland (980,000). Around 264,000 refugees are in the UK.
- The World Bank estimates Ukraine's GDP fell 29% in 2022 and poverty rates rose 1.7 times from 2021 to 2023 (from 21% to 36% of the population).
- Reconstruction and recovery costs were estimated at US$524 billion by the World Bank in April 2025.
- The UK provided £342 million in bilateral aid in 2022 (falling to £250m in 2023 and rising to £270m in 2024) and was the seventh-largest donor of aid to Ukraine in 2023.
- Specific UK pledges include £577 million in humanitarian aid (Feb 2022–Mar 2026), £470 million for energy security, and US$100 million (£74 million) for the Ukrainian government budget via a World Bank scheme.
- From Dec 2021 to Feb 2024, the UK announced £6.5 billion of fiscal support via World Bank loan guarantees and grants; UK Export Finance has a £3.5 billion "market risk appetite" for Ukraine reconstruction/trade.
- The G7 committed $44 billion in budget/economic support for 2023-2024 and launched "extraordinary revenue acceleration loans" to make available $50 billion by the end of 2024.
- Together with donors, the World Bank has mobilized $88 billion in finance for Ukraine from Feb 2022 to Jan 2026.
- The IMF announced a $15.6 billion program for 2022–2027 and reached preliminary agreement on a new $8.1 billion program in November 2025.

### Russia’s Grinding War in Ukraine
**Source:** csis.org, January 27, 2026

- Russia has suffered approximately 1.2 million casualties (killed, wounded, missing) and 275,000–325,000 killed since February 2022—more losses than any major power in any war since WWII.
- Combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may reach 2 million by spring 2026; Ukrainian casualties are estimated at 500,000–600,000 (including 100,000–140,000 killed), a ratio of roughly 2.5:1 or 2:1 compared to Russian losses.
- Despite holding the initiative since Jan 2024, Russian advances are historically slow: in the Pokrovsk offensive (Feb 2024–Jan 2026), forces advanced ~50km at a rate of 70 meters/day; in Chasiv Yar, the rate was just 15 meters/day.
- In total, Russia has seized ~75,000 sq km (~12% of Ukraine) since 2022 and controls ~120,000 sq km (~20%) including pre-2022 territories; in 2025, Russia gained only ~4,831 sq km (0.8% of Ukraine).
- Russia’s war economy is under strain: manufacturing is declining, growth slowed to 0.6% in 2025 (IMF forecasts 0.8% for 2026), and the country has zero companies in the top 100 global tech firms by market cap.
- Ukraine’s energy system can meet only 60% of national demand as of Jan 2026 due to Russian strikes.
- Russia has become heavily dependent on China, which accounted for 33.8% of Russia's foreign trade in 2024 and supplies 70% of Russia's ammonium perchlorate (missile fuel) imports.
- Russian space capability has collapsed to 17 orbital launches in 2025 (vs. 193 for the U.S. and 92 for China), including a Dec 2025 launchpad accident.
- Internal polling suggests a flip in Russian sentiment: in May 2023, 57% believed their circle supported the war vs. 39% opposed; by Oct 2025, 55% believed their circle opposed the war vs. 45% supported.
- The report suggests the U.S./Europe can exploit vulnerabilities via energy sanctions (potentially 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil) and targeting Russia's "shadow fleet" of oil tankers.

### Four years on, Russia is still paying for a fatal miscalculation in Ukraine | CNN
**Source:** cnn.com, February 21, 2026

- RUSI research indicates the Kremlin expected to take control of Ukraine within 10 days; more than 1,450 days later, the war has resulted in devastation and high losses.
- CSIS estimates nearly 1.2 million Russian dead and injured, including up to 325,000 killed—triple the combined losses of U.S. forces in every war since 1945 (Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq).
- Ukraine’s stated military aim is to kill Russian soldiers faster than new recruits can be trained; Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov stated, "If we reach 50,000 [monthly kills], we will see what happens to the enemy."
- Russia has faced diplomatic and strategic failures: the invasion prompted Sweden and Finland to join NATO (more than doubling Russia's land border with the alliance) and forced a pivot to China, making Moscow the "junior partner."
- Russia’s economy, while growing to the 9th largest globally in 2025 (IMF), faces "creeping financial pain" including galloping inflation, tax increases, and severe labor shortages (Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported a need for 800,000 blue-collar workers).
- Consumer prices have spiked, with official statistics showing cucumber prices doubling since December; one citizen posted online, "Once, they said eggs were 'golden'. Now it’s cucumbers."
- Russia has been unable to protect key allies: Bashar al-Assad was toppled and evacuated to Moscow (where the new Syrian president wants him extradited), and the Kremlin stood by as US/Israeli forces struck Iran and US troops seized Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro.

### Negotiating with Putin's Russia - Atlantic Council
**Source:** atlanticcouncil.org, **Date:** 2025-08-15

*   **Alaska Summit (August 15, 2025):** Presidents Trump and Putin met in Anchorage for a widely publicized but inconclusive summit. This marked Putin's first visit to the U.S. since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
*   **Putin's Strategic Objectives:** Putin aimed to position Russia as a global power equal to the U.S. (excluding European allies), consolidate control over occupied Ukrainian territories, lock Ukraine out of NATO, and persuade the U.S. to defer new sanctions. He sought to frame the conflict as a "family tragedy" rather than an invasion.
*   **Psychological Tactics:** Putin used flattery and appeals to Trump's deal-making desire (e.g., joint Arctic development) to distract from the lack of a resolution for Ukraine. Russian state media portrayed the summit as a victory, demonstrating Russia was not isolated.
*   **Summit Friction:** A lengthy historical lecture by Putin justifying the war—invoking figures like Rurik of Novgorod and Bohdan Khmelnytsky—surprised Trump. Sources told the *Financial Times* that Trump raised his voice and threatened to leave. The agenda was cut short, and the Russian delegation left before the planned lunch.
*   **Diplomatic Philosophy:** Russia views negotiations as a form of warfare by non-military means, aiming to win with few compromises. This contrasts with the Western view (post-1648 Treaty of Westphalia) where diplomacy seeks to reduce conflict. Russia views sovereignty as contingent on power, not applicable to former colonial possessions.
*   **Siloviki Influence:** The Russian state has evolved into an "intelligence state" dominated by *siloviki* (men of force from the FSB, SVR, FSO, GRU). These actors view the U.S. and Europe as enemies and believe the Cold War never ended.
*   **"Kremlin School of Negotiation" Tactics:** A specific 5-step methodology is taught to Russian diplomats: (1) Silence/listening, (2) Rapid interrogatory questions to establish control, (3) Diminishing the opponent via passive-aggressiveness, (4) Magnanimous gestures to offer an "escape," and (5) Creating uncertainty/ambiguity.
*   **Additional Tactical Plays:** Russia employs "time and energy exhaustion" (e.g., 16-hour Minsk-II talks, 12-hour Saudi Arabia talks), "deep anchoring" (making maximalist demands to shift the negotiation midpoint), and "principal-agent traps" (claiming low-level delegates need time to get approval from Moscow).
*   **Deception and Legalism:** Deception (*maskirovka*) is considered a justifiable tool, with no firewall between diplomats and spies. Russia also uses vague legal language in treaties to allow for reinterpretation later, as seen in the Minsk Accords and the Azov Sea agreement.
*   **Current War Context:** In 2025, Russia continues to reject all major U.S. peace proposals while Ukraine accepted them. Russia uses "deal packaging" to link unrelated issues (e.g., arms control) to Ukraine demands. They also engage in brinkmanship, threatening nuclear war and attacking targets near NATO borders.
*   **Geopolitical Leverage:** The authors suggest the recent U.S. military operation in Venezuela could signal resolve to Russia. However, U.S. distraction with the Western Hemisphere might also embolden Russia to tighten its grip on Ukraine.
*   **Recommended Countermeasures:** The U.S. should define success by advancing foreign policy goals, not just "good relations." Empowering Ukraine to disrupt Russian forces 30-300km behind the front line and tightening sanctions (specifically the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025) would alter Putin's calculus.

- US President Donald Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner are scheduled to arrive in Geneva by private jet at 8 am on Tuesday to conduct back-to-back high-stakes negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program and the Russia-Ukraine war.
- Indirect talks between the US and Iran will be held at Oman's permanent mission in Chambésy, following an initial round of discussions held 10 days prior in Muscat; both powers described the previous talks, the first since Washington struck Iranian nuclear sites in June, as a "good start."

### Russia's economy is now eating its own muscle as Putin's war on Ukraine destroys future capacity
**Source:** Fortune, February 22, 2026

- Four years after the invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has entered a "death zone," a mountaineering term used by Alexandra Prokopenko (Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center fellow and former Russian central bank advisor) to describe when high altitude forces the body to consume itself faster than it can repair.
- Prokopenko characterizes the economy as being in "negative equilibrium," holding together while destroying its own future capacity through "military rent"—budget transfers to defense enterprises that generate wages for assets designed for destruction (tanks, weapons).
- Economic data shows GDP stagnation, oil revenue halved by Western sanctions, and a rapidly draining budget deficit; interest payments on government debt are set to exceed spending on education and health care combined.
- Two economic systems have emerged: a prioritized military-industrial sector and a civilian sector "left in the cold."
- Russian officials have warned Putin that a financial crisis could hit by summer, citing a 50% crash in oil revenue in January year-over-year and a widening budget deficit despite consumer tax hikes.
- A Moscow business executive told the Washington Post that the crisis could arrive in "three or four months," noting spiraling inflation, restaurant closures, and thousands of layoffs.
- The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed; money spent on recruitment results in personnel who often die or return permanently wounded rather than becoming more productive workers.
- The economic predicament is compared to altitude sickness—prolonged stay worsens the condition—yet Putin cannot afford "climbing back down" (demobilization) without triggering a crisis, as the economy is now heavily reliant on the defense sector.
- A Russian official warned anonymously in December of the possibility of a "banking crisis" or "nonpayments crisis."
- Ukraine has launched a counterattack in recent weeks, capitalizing on Russian troops being cut off from SpaceX's Starlink service; the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) estimates Ukraine has liberated 168.9 square kilometers of territory since Jan. 1.
- ISW Deputy Russia Team Lead Christina Harward noted Russia is suffering casualties faster than it can recruit, suggesting Putin may need a limited, rolling military call-up to sustain the war.

### Ukraine, Russia end second round of peace talks with agreement on prisoner swap, new meeting

- US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff described the discussions as "constructive" and focused on creating conditions for "durable peace," demonstrating that diplomacy is "delivering tangible results."
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed some released POWs had been held for nearly four years and announced that the next round of talks would likely be held in the United States.
- Zelenskiy reiterated Ukraine's insistence on robust security guarantees from Washington to ensure Russia does not attack again, stating any diplomatic format must "deprive Russia of the appetite to continue fighting."
- US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that further sanctions on Russia would depend on the progress of the talks; he maintained that Russia's 2022 invasion was illegal and that Vladimir Putin is a "war criminal."
- Russian envoy
