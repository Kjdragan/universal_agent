## Archive Process

When archiving a document:
1. Move it to this directory with a clear archive prefix: `0{OriginalNumber}_Title_Archived_{Date}.md`
2. Add an archive notice at the top explaining:
   - Original date and status
   - Archive date
   - What document supersedes it
   - Why it was archived
3. Update this index
4. Update any cross-references in active documents

## For Reference

Archived documents are preserved for historical context but should not be used for current implementation. Always refer to the superseding document for accurate information.
