The first report about AI is: I want you to research the important developments in artificial intelligence during 2025. You'll need significant research to come and determine which research has been the most interesting or important,  For the second report, I want you to come up with your expectations for trends in artificial intelligence during the first half of 2026. Again, this should be grounded in research, which will have to be comp comprehensive.",
