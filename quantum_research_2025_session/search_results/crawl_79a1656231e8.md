With tech giants and specialized startups racing to develop quantum hardware and software, 2026 could prove to be a pivotal year for this high-potential sector. This article highlights eight of the best quantum computing stocks to buy, their market performance, analyst forecasts, and growth potential.
‍
## Why Consider Quantum Computing Investments
Quantum computing is a long-term technological development with potential future impacts across multiple sectors, including cryptography, drug discovery, climate modeling, and financial analysis.
Investments in quantum computing companies are fundamentally different from typical tech investments. Keep in mind that this technology may take up to 10 years to reach commercial maturity. While there's potential for significant returns if the technology achieves its promised breakthroughs, investors should understand that this sector carries substantial technical, commercial, and timing risks. Most quantum computing investments are best viewed as a small, speculative portion of a diversified portfolio with a multi-year time horizon.

## Key Players in the Quantum Computing Industry
With the quantum computing industry on the rise, several major companies stand out due to their substantial contributions and impressive market presence. Leading the pack is IBM, which was the first to offer cloud-based quantum computing access, making it a pioneer in the field.
IBM continues to advance with its Quantum Experience project. In 2022, the tech giant released a 433-qubit processor named Osprey and introduced Condor, a 1,121-qubit processor, a year later. IBM expects this system to eventually achieve quantum advantage, solving problems more efficiently than a supercomputer.
Google’s Quantum AI is another force to reckon with in the quantum computing world. In 2023, the company unveiled Sycamore 2, and in early 2024, it released Willow, a new quantum processor that completed a complex calculation in under five minutes—one that would take a supercomputer significantly longer. With quantum supremacy already demonstrated, Google is now focused on scaling up qubits and improving error correction to bring practical quantum computing closer to reality.
D-Wave Quantum Inc., meanwhile, has doubled down on its hybrid quantum-classical approach, combining quantum annealing with AI-driven tools to address real-world optimization problems. In 2024, the company expanded its Leap platform, allowing more businesses to access quantum solutions via the cloud. As of 2025, D-Wave is also working on gate-model quantum computing, broadening its technological reach and investment appeal.
BlueQubit is similarly involved in the quantum computing industry. Known for its user-friendly platform and lightning-fast quantum emulators, the company democratizes access to quantum hardware by offering cloud-based tools for real-time experimentation. BlueQubit’s focus on accessibility and performance is attracting attention among startups, researchers, and developers looking to benefit from quantum technology.

## 8 Top Quantum Computing Stocks for 2026
The stock market is heating up, with many quantum computing businesses showcasing impressive prospects. To help you make an informed decision, we’ve compiled a quantum computing stocks list to keep an eye on. When considering quantum stocks like IonQ Inc. (IONQ), investors should understand that valuations in this emerging sector are highly speculative. Some analysts project potential growth based on the company's trapped-ion technology and commercial partnerships, but these investments come with significant volatility and uncertainty as the quantum computing market develops. Rather than focusing solely on price targets, investors might consider evaluating companies based on their technological approach, strategic partnerships, and progress toward practical applications. 
‍

‍
### 1. IonQ Inc. (IONQ)
IonQ Inc. is a top contender when it comes to the quantum stock market. With its unique trapped-ion technology, the Maryland-based company is steadily carving a niche for itself. IonQ claims this approach offers longer qubit lifetimes and more straightforward scalability, making their quantum computers more powerful and accurate.
As of December 2025, IonQ’s average price target is $70.83, with a forecasted upside of 42.44%. This positive shift points toward growing investor confidence in IonQ’s trapped-ion technology and its commercial potential. Despite the quantum computing sector being quite volatile, 9 out of 17 analysts are rating IonQ as a buy.
‍
### 2. D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS)
With a specialized approach to quantum technology, D-Wave Quantum Inc. is another one of the best quantum computing stocks to buy. The Canadian company uses quantum annealing, a process that involves solving complex optimization problems swiftly and efficiently. This technique has potential use cases in various fields, like machine learning and materials science, making D-Wave Quantum's stock an exciting investment option.
Analyst sentiment towards QBTS is bullish. The stock is currently trading 41.52% above the 200-day SMA. Meanwhile, its value grew by 408.4% over the past year. 
‍
### 3. Rigetti Computing Inc. (RGTI)
Emerging from Berkeley, California, Rigetti Computing Inc. is making a name for itself in the world of quantum computing. The company specializes in developing quantum integrated circuits and is at the forefront of integrating AI and machine learning. Its latest 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system achieved 99.5% median 2-qubit gate fidelity—a major performance metric in quantum computing.
RGTI has a positive stock analysis, with six out of nine analysts rating it as a buy. Its average 12-month price target of $28.67 suggests an upside of 19.64% from the current stock price of $23.96.
‍
### 4. Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT)
Quantum Computing Inc. (QCI) aims to develop software tools and applications tailored for quantum machines. Its flagship product, Qatalyst, allows developers to design and implement quantum-ready applications on conventional computers using its cloud-based solution. 
QUBT's stock price grew by 66% over the past year. Analysts predict that if you buy $1,000 worth of QUBT today, you would earn $2,981.71 by March 2026. The quantum stock’s value is forecasted to reach $31.70 in three months, indicating an upside of 184.19% offer the current price of $11.27.
‍
### 5. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, continues to be a key player in quantum computing through its Quantum AI division. The company is involved in long-term research, including developing scalable error-corrected quantum systems that could solve real-world problems.
In terms of finance, Alphabet shows strong performance, reporting a 13.42% year-over-year revenue increase last year. The company reached $385.477 billion as of September 2025, up from $350.018 billion the year before. Analyst sentiment is bullish, with 45 out of 51 analysts rating the stock as a strong buy. Currently, GOOGL is trading at $306.57. 
Recent developments in Alphabet’s cloud and infrastructure business also reinforce this financial foundation. Google’s long-term infrastructure and AI services agreement with Meta 
highlights the growing demand for high-performance computing, data centers, and custom silicon. While this contract is not directly related to quantum computing, it strengthens Alphabet’s cash flow and capital base, indirectly supporting sustained investment in high-risk, long-horizon research like quantum technologies.
That being said, it’s also worth noting that quantum computing is only a part of Alphabet’s overall operations, which means that its impact on the company’s broader stock performance is limited for now.
