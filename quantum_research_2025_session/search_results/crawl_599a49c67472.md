### Our Quantum roadmap
### 8 billion reasons to build a quantum supercomputer
Our growing global footprint of 8 billion people requires new innovations to reverse climate change and address food insecurity. Scientists are on a mission to make discoveries that will solve humanity’s hardest problems. This is why we are pushing the boundaries to empower scientists to innovate at scale, with speed.

##  Quantum Supercomputer
Microsoft is developing a topological qubit that is unique, small, fast, and controllable, which will unlock a scaled Quantum Supercomputer.
##  Quantum Computing Implementation Levels
To achieve utility scale, quantum computing must graduate through three implementation levels: Level 1 Foundational, Level 2 Resilient, Level 3 Scale.
##  Quantum Networking
Quantum networking has the potential to unlock capabilities by connecting remote quantum computers and solving problems distributed on quantum clusters.

!Create & control Majoranas
Accomplished
####  MILESTONE 01: Create & control Majoranas 
For the first time in history, Microsoft engineered devices allow us to induce and control the topological phase of matter bookended by Majorana Zero Modes. This breakthrough enables the engineering of a new type of qubit*.
*Accomplished in May 2023 with the peer-reviewed research published in American Physical Society journal
!Hardware Protected Qubit
Accomplished
####  MILESTONE 02: Hardware Protected Qubit 
Our protected qubit, with built-in error protection, extends our first breakthrough by changing qubit technology from analog to digital control.
!High Quality Hardware Protected Qubits
####  MILESTONE 03: High Quality Hardware Protected Qubits 
To scale operations and reduce errors, digitally controlled hardware-protected qubits can be entangled and braided with a series of quality advances.
!Multi-qubit System
####  MILESTONE 04: Multi-qubit System 
A variety of quantum algorithms can be executed when multiple qubits operate together as a programmable Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in a full stack Quantum Machine.
!Resilient Quantum System
####  MILESTONE 05: Resilient Quantum System 
A Quantum Machine, when operating on true logical qubits, demonstrates higher quality operations than the underlying physical qubits. This breakthrough enables the first reliable quantum operations and opens the gates to quantum supercomputing.
!Quantum Supercomputer
####  MILESTONE 06: Quantum Supercomputer 
The Quantum Supercomputer solves scientific or commercial problems faster than classical computers, starting at 1 million reliable rQOPS/sec with an error rate below 1 in a trillion, scaling to 100 million rQOPS/sec for advanced chemistry and materials science challenges.
