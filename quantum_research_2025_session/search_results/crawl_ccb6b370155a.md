!Top 7 must-read quantum tech stories of 2025.
One of the most important themes of 2025 was maturation of quantum hardware.IE/Yazan AL Sayed
The year 2025 marked a turning point for quantum technology, shifting the field from promise-heavy experimentation toward clearer signs of practical impact. The year stood out for meaningful progress across hardware, software, communications, and policy. Instead of a single headline breakthrough, 2025 was defined by steady, coordinated advances that made quantum tech feel less speculative and more inevitable.One of the most important themes of 2025 was the maturation of quantum hardware. Qubit counts continued to rise, but more importantly, error rates fell and system stability improved. Companies and research labs focused heavily on error mitigation, better control electronics, and scalable architectures rather than just raw qubit numbers. Multiple approaches—superconducting, trapped ions, photonics, and neutral atoms—showed credible paths forward, reinforcing the idea that the field is converging on solutions, not dead ends.1. US mathematicians turn ‘useless’ math into breakthrough for quantum computing
## 1. US mathematicians turn ‘useless’ math into breakthrough for quantum computing

Researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) in the US turned to an often overlooked particle for storing and processing quantum information to overcome the fragility of quantum computers and make them more universal in the near future. Positioning one such particle in a quantum computer can help overcome errors in quantum computing.In this approach, researchers work to secure quantum information by encoding it into the geometric properties of exotic particles called anyons. Predicted to exist in two dimensions, anyons are considered more resistant to noise and interference than other qubits, with Ising anyons leading the development of these quantum systems. 
## 2. World’s first quantum computer built using standard silicon chips launched

London-based Quantum Motion, a quantum computing startup that develops scalable quantum computing tech using silicon, launched the industry’s first full-stack quantum computer made with silicon. It was deployed at the UK National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC). This is reportedly the first quantum computer to be built using the standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chip fabrication process which is the same transistor technology used in conventional computers.A key part of this approach is building cryoelectronics that connect qubits with control circuits that work at very low temperatures, making it possible to scale up quantum processors greatly.
## 3. World-first: US quantum computer solves problem million years faster than supercomputer

D-Wave Quantum Inc., a California-based startup working in the realm of quantum computing for commercial applications, has solved a real-world useful problem using its D-Wave Advantage 2 prototype annealing quantum computer.The company confirmed its achievement through a peer-reviewed paper in a highly reputed scientific journal. According to Moore’s Law, a microchip’s computing power and efficiency doubles every two years. In the short time since computers have been around, we have seen a massive change in their capabilities, even as they continue to shrink in size.Yet, scientists have been working to build bigger and better computers to carry out exascale computations and help us solve problems like climate change and drug discovery. 
## 4. Century-old math puzzle that stumped top supercomputers solved by quantum computing

Researchers have successfully used a quantum algorithm to solve a complex century-old mathematical problem long considered impossible for even the most powerful conventional supercomputers.The achievement has direct applications in fields including particle physics, material science, and data transmission.“Is there a computational problem that has an efficient quantum algorithm but no efficient randomized algorithm? Quantum computing is driven by the belief that the answer is yes,” said the researchers in a new study. The work was conducted by Martín Larocca, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Vojtěch Havlíček, a researcher at IBM. In a paper published in Physical Review Letters, they demonstrate that quantum computers can “factor group representations,” a foundational task in several scientific disciplines.
## 5. Van Gogh’s iconic ‘The Starry Night’ painting helps discover a new quantum vortex

Famous American writer Isaac Asimov once said, “There is an art to science, and science in art.” A new study proved this quote right by highlighting a never-before-seen connection between Vincent van Gogh’s famous painting “The Starry Night” and quantum physics.The main focus of the study is the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI), an effect observed in the everyday world when two fluids slide past each other at different speeds, which can sculpt waves and whorls in clouds, rivers, or ocean surfaces.Until now, no one had actually seen KHI in a quantum fluid. However, the authors of the current study not only captured it for the first time but also discovered crescent-shaped vortices, known as eccentric fractional skyrmions (EFSs), which bear a striking resemblance to the glowing moon in van Gogh’s The Starry Night.
## 6. Japan researchers harness quantum entanglement to boost robot posture control

Researchers from Shibaura Institute of Technology, Waseda University, and Fujitsu have developed a novel way to make robots move smoothly and efficiently using quantum computing.Usually, when a robot moves, its computer has to calculate how each of its joints should bend so that its hand or foot ends up in the right spot. This process, known as inverse kinematics, is extremely difficult for robots like humanoids because there are countless possible combinations.The team’s new approach uses qubits to represent the position and orientation of each part of the robot. Even more importantly, they use quantum entanglement – a special feature of quantum mechanics where particles are linked so that the movement of one affects the other.
## 7. MIT sets world record with 99.998% fidelity in quantum computing breakthrough

Researchers at MIT developed two new control techniques that have enabled them to achieve a world-record single-qubit fidelity of 99.998 percent using a superconducting qubit called fluxonium.This breakthrough marks a significant step towards the realization of practical quantum computing. Qubits, the building blocks of quantum computers, are highly susceptible to noise and control imperfections. This introduces errors into the quantum operations and ultimately limits the complexity and duration of a quantum algorithm.The researchers developed two techniques: ‘commensurate pulses’ and ‘circularly polarized microwaves,’ which effectively eliminate these errors.The team’s approach involved applying pulses at specific times to make counter-rotating errors consistent and correctable. They also utilized a synthetic version of circularly polarized light to control the qubit’s state, further enhancing fidelity.
2025 was a year of strategic alignment and global competition. While challenges remain—especially scalability and cost—the momentum in 2025 made it clear that quantum technology has moved into a more serious, durable phase of innovation, setting the stage for even larger breakthroughs later in the decade.
