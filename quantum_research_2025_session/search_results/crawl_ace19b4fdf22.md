# Research at Microsoft 2025: Translating ideas into action
### In 2025, AI moved beyond the lab and into daily life across the globe.
Innovation accelerated at an unprecedented rate. Abstract concepts quickly became practical tools that let scientists sculpt new materials, doctors decode complex proteins, workers amplify their skills and productivity, and communities acquire critical knowledge that can save or improve lives. 
This year, Microsoft Research focused on turning ideas into action and achieving tangible benefits for humanity. Through that work, we’re accelerating materials discovery, replacing costly trial and error with precision and speed, and our efforts on protein structure prediction are helping researchers understand biological complexity in ways that pave the way for new medical treatments. And we’re building multilingual and culturally aware AI that serves real-world needs. In Kenya and India, we’re helping smallholder farmers access information and guidance that can improve crop yields and reduce food insecurity. In communities where low-resource languages dominate, we’re creating speech-first tools that deliver locally grounded, verifiable answers.
> “The true value of AI…we haven’t yet imagined and it hasn’t been invented. And yet we are in a race to have the deployment infrastructure to deliver AI to the entire world.”
> _–_ Peter Lee, President, Microsoft Research
We’re also advancing creativity and multimodal intelligence. For example, our first generative AI model for gameplay ideation and our work on foundation models for multimodal AI agents demonstrate how AI can play a role in design and interaction across digital and physical realms—enabling technological leaders and creators to do more.
Through it all, responsible AI remains central to our mission. This year, we developed tools that strengthen trust by improving the fact-checking of LLM outputs and detecting hallucinations in complex workflows. In addition, our AI testing and evaluation work explored lessons from domains like cybersecurity and healthcare to help guide governance and ensure reliability.
Beyond AI, we pushed the boundaries of computing itself with the world’s first quantum processor powered by topological qubits and with a light-powered system that handles complex computational tasks with unprecedented speed and energy efficiency. We also explored metasurfaces for next-generation wireless sensing and communication and strengthened security by rewriting Microsoft’s cryptographic library and developing a conservative quantum-safe cryptographic algorithm designed for a post-quantum world. 
Story What's next in AI? 
Field notes from Microsoft Research for 2026
None of this happens in isolation, of course. Like most technological and scientific breakthroughs, our progress continues to emerge through collaboration and collective insight. In 2025, we convened experts at our inaugural summit to explore how AI can accelerate clean-energy research. We also celebrated 20 years of Microsoft Research India and opened a new lab in Singapore, expanding our global network and reinforcing our commitment to partnerships and collaboration.
As this post clearly shows, Microsoft Research is harnessing the transformative power of AI not only to build the future but also to build it responsibly, collaboratively, and for the benefit of people everywhere.
