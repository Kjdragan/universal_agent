In this article, we will look at the **10 Best Performing Quantum Computing Stocks in 2025**.
On November 12, Ray Harishankar, IBM Fellow at IBM Research, appeared on a CNBC interview to discuss how quantum computing is quickly transitioning towards daily use. Harishankar noted that the world has made immense progress in quantum technology in the last decade, compared to other times in history. He noted that one recent example of quantum computing progress occurred a few months ago when HSBC announced its use of IBM’s quantum computing to develop a quantum model for calculating bond derivatives. Notably, this model resulted in a 35% improvement in performance. Harishankar noted that this is just one incident among many others that suggest that quantum computing is real, already delivering results, and progressing every day.
He added that, in addition to HSBC, several other financial institutions, including Wells Fargo and Vanguard, have been experimenting with quantum computing to enhance their daily performance. Harishankar noted that they made the first quantum computer available at IBM Cloud in 2016. Since then, the company has deployed more than 80 quantum computers on the cloud, which are available for general use. In addition, the company has over 9 quantum computers deployed at specific client locations. Harishankar noted that currently, quantum computers experience certain errors or faults. He added that looking ahead, he expects the technology to be flawless and ready to use for daily business use by 2028 to 2029.
With that, let’s take a look at the 10 Best Performing Quantum Computing Stocks in 2025.

From this list, we shortlisted the stocks that have performed more than 30% year-to-date and are also popular among hedge funds. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the year-to-date performance. We have added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2025 database.
​Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 427.7% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 264 percentage points (**see more details here**).

# The $250 Trillion AI Hype is Real. A few years from now, you’ll probably wish you’d bought this stock.
###### Published on November 14, 2025 at by  Inan Dogan, PhD
When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.
Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described **generative AI** as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.
At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by **2040** there would be **at least 10 billion humanoid robots** , with each priced between **$20,000 and $25,000**.
Do the math. According to Musk, **this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.**
Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:
  * 175 Teslas
  * 107 Amazons
  * 140 Metas
  * 84 Googles
  * 65 Microsofts
  * And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave **isn’t** tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.
It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.
Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.
**How could anything be worth that much?**
The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.
And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.
What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.
In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.
Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.
  * Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.
  * Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.
  * Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.
Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…
But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.
And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

# AI, Tariffs, Nuclear Power: One Undervalued Stock Connects ALL the Dots (Before It Explodes!)
###### Published on October 5, 2025 at by  Inan Dogan, PhD
Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!
AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.
Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, **AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink**.
Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:
**Where will all of that energy come from?**
AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes **as much energy as a small city**. And it’s about to get worse.
Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:
“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”
Elon Musk was even more blunt:
“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”
As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. **Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.**
And that’s where the real opportunity lies…
**One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play.** It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.
As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.
**The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom**
  * It owns critical **nuclear energy infrastructure assets** , positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.
  * It’s one of the **only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects** across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.
  * It plays **a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation** —a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy **American** LNG.
And our company sits in the toll booth—**collecting fees on every drop exported.**
But that’s not all…
As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be **first in line** to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.
**AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.**
While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company **powering it all from behind the scenes**.
AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.
And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.
This company has its finger in every pie—and **Wall Street is just starting to notice**.
Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.
While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…
**This company is completely debt-free.**
In fact, it’s sitting on a **war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap**.
It also owns a **huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play** , giving investors **indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines** without paying a premium.
And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…
**The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out**
This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that **some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits**.
They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.
Why? Because **excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings**.
And that’s for a business tied to:
  * The **AI infrastructure supercycle**
  * The **onshoring boom** driven by Trump-era tariffs
  * A surge in **U.S. LNG exports**
  * And a unique footprint in **nuclear energy** —the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock **this cheap** … with **this much upside**.
**This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.**
It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.
This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!
**Disruption is the New Name of the Game:** Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.
AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.
The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.
As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.
**The Talent Pool is Overflowing:** The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.
From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.
This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.
By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.
The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.
