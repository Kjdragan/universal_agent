#### **6. Microsoft**
!Microsoft logo
Microsoft has positioned itself as a key player in the global quantum computing race, driven by a long-term vision of developing scalable, fault-tolerant systems built on topological qubit architecture. Its quantum program is anchored by Azure Quantum, a cloud-based, hardware-agnostic platform that brings together software tools, third-party quantum hardware, and cloud-native development environments. This open ecosystem enables developers, researchers, and enterprises to build quantum algorithms today that are compatible with future quantum hardware , bridging near-term experimentation with long-term strategic capability.
Microsoft’s entry into quantum computing followed the efforts of its Quantum Architectures and Computation (QuArC) group, based in Redmond and led by Krysta Svore, which laid the early groundwork for quantum algorithm development and quantum circuit theory. In 2017, Microsoft launched Q#, a domain-specific programming language for quantum computing, along with its Quantum Development Kit (QDK), offering compilers, emulators, and integration with Visual Studio and Python. The QDK was open-sourced in 2019 to encourage transparency and community participation after a setback involving a retracted scientific paper on Majorana particles, a foundational element in Microsoft’s topological qubit approach.
In recent years, Microsoft has doubled down on its topological strategy. In July 2025, it published findings on its Majorana 1 chip, a new quantum prototype built using novel “topoconductor” materials to stabilize Majorana zero modes. While initial benchmarking met “Milestone 1” on Microsoft’s roadmap, key experimental validations , such as demonstrating anti-commutation between Pauli measurements , remain incomplete, meaning a true topological qubit has not yet been realized. Despite these hurdles, the company views topological qubits as a pathway to massively scalable systems with inherently low error rates, capable of reaching a million-qubit regime.
Azure Quantum continues to evolve, integrating quantum hardware from partners like Quantinuum and Atom Computing. In 2025, Microsoft collaborated with Quantinuum to achieve high-fidelity entanglement of 12 logical qubits and is co-developing a 24-logical-qubit commercial system with Atom Computing. The company has also introduced AI-powered quantum chemistry tools , Generative Chemistry and Accelerated DFT , and added post-quantum cryptography capabilities to SymCrypt, its core cryptographic library used across Azure and Microsoft 365.
Software advancements have kept pace with hardware ambition. Microsoft has open-sourced its Azure Quantum Resource Estimator, allowing developers to simulate resource requirements for error-corrected quantum algorithms. Meanwhile, the Azure Quantum platform continues to serve as a unifying layer for both hardware and software, with tools that facilitate the integration of quantum algorithms into existing classical workflows.
Although Microsoft closed its quantum research facility in Sydney in 2024 to consolidate operations in the United States, the company remains globally engaged, collaborating with academic, industrial, and governmental partners. Under the leadership of Julie Love, Partner and Product Leader for Quantum Computing, Microsoft’s quantum strategy reflects both patience and persistence, focusing on high-risk, high-reward innovation to ultimately achieve practical quantum advantage through topological fault-tolerant architectures.

#### 7. NVIDIA

NVIDIA is a core enabler of hybrid quantum–classical computing and does not build its own quantum processing units (QPUs). Instead, the company supplies the acceleration stack — GPUs, software, and reference architectures — that lets developers design, simulate, and orchestrate quantum workloads alongside classical HPC and AI.
NVIDIA’s quantum software foundation is CUDA-Q (formerly QODA), an open, qubit-agnostic programming model for writing hybrid CPU/GPU/QPU workflows. CUDA-Q targets external quantum hardware through provider plug-ins while also driving high-performance simulation on NVIDIA GPUs. Complementing this, cuQuantum delivers optimized libraries for state-vector and tensor-network simulation, enabling researchers to validate algorithms, study error mechanisms, and prototype error-correction strategies at scales impractical on current QPUs.
For enterprise and cloud deployment, NVIDIA Quantum Cloud packages these capabilities as managed microservices, integrating with major public clouds so teams can spin up large simulations without building bespoke HPC environments. On the systems side, DGX Quantum — co-developed with Quantum Machines — provides a reference architecture that tightly couples GPU nodes to QPU control hardware, reducing latency and simplifying real-time feedback between classical accelerators and external quantum devices.
NVIDIA’s ecosystem is intentionally QPU-agnostic. The company partners with leading hardware makers and labs across trapped-ion, superconducting, neutral-atom, photonic, and annealing modalities, positioning its stack as the common layer for development, scheduling, calibration assistance, and large-scale simulation. High-visibility collaborations have used fleets of NVIDIA GPUs to emulate complex device physics and mid-scale circuits, stress-testing error-correction schemes and control protocols before committing to scarce QPU time.
The result is a pragmatic role: accelerate near-term research and industrial experimentation, standardize hybrid programming patterns, and compress iteration cycles — while leaving QPU design and manufacturing to specialized vendors. With CUDA-Q, cuQuantum, Quantum Cloud, and DGX Quantum, NVIDIA has become a default backbone for quantum R&D across academia, industry, and government — without competing as a QPU builder.
