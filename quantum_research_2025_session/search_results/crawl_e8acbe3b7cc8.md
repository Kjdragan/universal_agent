2025 is shaping up to be a landmark year for UK tech, with funding rounds reaching unprecedented scale and signalling strong investor confidence across both established and emerging sectors. From fintech giants to deep-tech pioneers, UK startups are not only attracting global capital but also shaping industries that will define the next decade. 
These investments show how the UK is evolving from a regional hub into a global centre for technological innovation. But the billions flowing into British startups represent more than financial scale. They reflect where the world believes the future is being built. 
The biggest rounds of 2025 highlight the technologies expected to have the most profound impact, including AI infrastructure, quantum computing, biotech, and next-generation financial services. Together, they show that the UK is not merely participating in the global tech race but actively leading it.
## **Revolut**

Founders: Nikolay Storonsky, Vlad YatsenkoFounded: 2015Latest funding: $2B
The UK-based fintech “neobank” Revolut started as a currency exchange and money-transfer app. Revolut has since expanded into a full suite of digital banking services, including multi-currency accounts, payments, debit/credit cards, stock trading, crypto exchange, savings and investments, business banking, BNPL, and more, all accessible through its mobile app. As of 2025, Revolut operates across dozens of countries and serves tens of millions of customers globally.
In July 2025, Revolut closed a funding round totalling $2 billion at a post-money valuation of about $75 billion, up sharply from $45 billion the previous year. 
This round enables Revolut to invest aggressively in growth: fund product development, accelerate global expansion in the US, Asia and other new markets, deepen regulatory engagement, and increase customer acquisition. 
## **Nscale**

Founders: Josh PayneFounded: 2023Latest funding: $1.1B
Nscale builds and operates “AI-native” data centres: vertically integrated infrastructure offering compute, networking, storage, and managed software services, optimised for large-scale AI workloads, model training, inference, and other machine-learning needs. 
Its data centres emphasise sovereign infrastructure (locally controlled and compliant with regulations) and aim to meet rising enterprise and governmental demand for secure, high-performance AI compute capacity across Europe, North America, and the Middle East. 
In September 2025, Nscale closed a $1.1 billion Series B round, the largest Series B in European history, led by Norwegian industrial group Aker ASA with participation from major investors including NVIDIA, Dell Technologies, Nokia, Blue Owl and others. 
The funds will be used to rapidly scale Nscale’s global AI infrastructure footprint, expanding its data centres, rolling out GPU farms for clients, including big tech firms, and building out its vertically integrated AI cloud platform. 
## **CityFibre**

Founders: Greg MeschFounded: 2011Latest funding: £2.3 billion
CityFibre builds and operates a wholesale, full-fibre (fibre-to-the-premises) network across the UK, providing pure fibre infrastructure for ultra-fast, reliable internet to homes and businesses, acting as an alternative to old copper networks. As the third-largest provider, after Openreach and Virgin, it focused on improving internet connectivity in ‘second cities’. 
It has secured a £2.3 billion total financing package that included £500 million in new equity, £960 million in expanded debt facilities, and an £800 million accordion facility. Far from a household name, even among people who use ISPs that use CityFibre, the investment underscores the importance of the wholesale network. 
With government targets and customer demand pushing for faster, more consistent internet connections nationwide, CityFibre may not be as sexy as AI, but it’s just as important.
## **FNZ**

Founders: Adrian DurhamFounded: 2003Latest funding: $650M
London-headquartered FNZ has long focused on building and providing infrastructure for investment platforms, wealth management and retail brokerage services, often powering backend operations for banks, advisors and financial institutions rather than direct consumer-facing banking.
Recently, FNZ raised $650 million from existing institutional shareholders. This substantial injection aims to support growth as FNZ expands its platform capabilities and deepens partnerships with wealth managers and banks, reinforcing its position as a backbone provider in the wealth-management industry.
## **Quantinuum**

Founders: Ilyas Khan, Darius AdamczykFounded: 2021Latest funding: $600M
A quantum computing unicorn, Quantinuum, builds full-stack quantum computing systems, from hardware (trapped-ion quantum processors) to developer tools, quantum software, and applications. Their platforms aim to support quantum chemistry, cryptography, optimisation, machine learning, and other advanced use-cases that classical computers struggle with. 
In September, Quantinuum secured $600 million in equity capital at a pre-money valuation of $10 billion. The raise attracted both new and existing investors, including NVIDIA’s venture arm, Quanta Computer, QED Investors, and others. 
The funds are earmarked to accelerate the development and deployment of its next-generation quantum computing system, “Helios”, and to scale quantum hardware, software, manufacturing, and global supply-chain capabilities, putting Quantinuum closer to achieving commercially useful, fault-tolerant quantum computing.
## **Isomorphic Labs**

Founders: Demis HassabisFounded: 2021Latest funding: $600M
A biotech company in this list is Isomorphic Labs, which leverages AI to revolutionise drug discovery and design. Its mission is to use AI to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics and bring them to the clinic faster than traditional methods allow. By applying AI-driven modelling of protein structures, drug–target interactions, and other advanced computational biology techniques, Isomorphic Labs aims to make drug discovery more efficient, scalable, and accessible. 
In March, Isomorphic Labs raised $600 million in its first external funding round. The round was led by Thrive Capital, with participation from longtime backer Alphabet and GV (formerly Google Ventures), among others. 
The capital is intended to accelerate the development of their next-generation AI drug-design engine and advance multiple therapeutic programs into preclinical and clinical stages, marking a major step in AI-driven biotech scaling.
## **Rapyd**

Founders: Arik Shtilman, Arkady Karpman, Omer PrielFounded year: 2015Latest funding: $500M
A borderless fintech-as-a-service platform, Rapyd, that powers payments, compliance, foreign exchange, fraud management, escrow, virtual accounts, and card issuing across over 100 countries. 
Rapyd’s platform empowers businesses to build payment, payout, and fintech experiences seamlessly both locally and internationally. Its global presence includes offices in London, Tel Aviv, Dubai, Iceland, San Francisco, Miami, Hong Kong, and Singapore, reflecting deep expertise in cross-border commerce. 
Earlier in 2025, Rapyd closed a $500 million funding round focused on expanding its global fintech capabilities. The recent fundraising will support Rapyd’s ongoing development of crypto and digital-asset offerings and deepen integrations with partner ecosystems, enhancing its comprehensive toolkit for global commerce.
## **Verdiva Bio**

Anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro have demonstrated a significant market for weight-management pharmaceuticals. Verdiva Bio is developing a range of medicines that advance this area, improving effectiveness and reducing side effects. 
Valued at $2.5 billion, Verdiva closed a $411 million Series A in January. The funding will support the company as it moves drugs through the development process. Their trials include oral medications that can potentially transform the treatment of obesity.

FluidStack operates a dual-model AI cloud: an asset-light marketplace aggregating third-party GPU capacity (38% of revenue) and a high-margin private cloud with owned infrastructure (62% of revenue). It manages 100,000+ GPUs, supporting H100, H200, B200, and GB200 chips, with tools such as Atlas OS for automated provisioning and Lighthouse for real-time optimisation. 
Customers, including Meta, Mistral AI, and Character.AI, can access clusters with up to 30,000 GPUs via the self-service console or API, with zero egress fees and enterprise-grade compliance.​
## **Nothing**
