###  Bid Price and Ask Price 
The  _bid_ &  _ask_ refers to the price that an investor is willing to buy or sell a stock.

The data displayed in the quote bar updates every 3 seconds; allowing you to monitor prices in real-time. The  _bid-ask spread_ can indicate a stock’s liquidity, which is how easy it is to buy and sell in the marketplace. Often, a smaller spread suggests higher liquidity, meaning more buyers and sellers in the market are willing to negotiate. In contrast, a larger spread suggests lower liquidity, as there are fewer investors willing to negotiate. You can use the bid-ask spread to determine whether to place a _market order_ or  _limit order_ when trading, helping you to optimize your price and have a successful order execution.
