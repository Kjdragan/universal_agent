## Unparalleled hardware innovation
IBM is at the forefront of quantum hardware development. By evolving chip and system architectures, we unlock new possibilities for quantum computing as we build toward large-scale, fault-tolerant systems.

### 01World-class fabrication
Our qubits are made using state-of-the-art 300mm semiconductor chip fabrication technologies. 
By putting semi-automated tooling to work in new ways, we are accelerating our development cycles. To date, we have cut the time needed to build each new processor by at least half, while enabling multiple designs to be researched and explored in parallel.

### 02Advanced packaging methods
From multi-layer wiring to tunable couplers, we’ve fine-tuned our signal delivery and packaging techniques to ensure qubit control scales with processor complexity.
We are also developing a new low-loss wiring layer to enable the distant qubit connections required for our qLDPC error-correcting code.

### 03Magnified processing power
We are pioneering inter-module communication with l-couplers, enabling computation across chips, modules, and systems. These microwave cables extend processing power in multi-QPU systems and soon fault-tolerant architectures.

### 04Scalable infrastructure
Building systems that can run billions of gates requires modular components that create a single cryogenic environment. From componentized fridge design to flex wiring, we continue to drive scalability and affordability.
We are also developing cryogenic CMOS control electronics, reducing system complexity and improving reliability.

## Explore IBM Quantum Cryostat
Close
The cryostat demo offers a detailed look inside an IBM quantum computing system. Our quantum processors need to be very cold—about a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero. This complex array of components creates the required ultra-cold environment. From top to bottom:
  * ### Hermetic Feedthrough
A tightly-sealed plate protects the flexible input wiring as it passes into the ultra-high vacuum fridge
  * ### Pulse Tube Cooler
This device provides initial cooling, down to temperatures of 4 kelvin. That’s -452.47° Fahrenheit, or -269.15° Celsius.
  * ### Flexible Ribbon Cables
Flexible printed circuit boards carry microwave signals into and out of this ultra-cold environment in an inexpensive, low-crosstalk manner.
  * ### HEMT amplifiers
These low-noise amplifiers take the weak readout signals from the qubits and make them large enough that they are not swamped by the electronic noise from the room temperature world outside the fridge.
  * ### Superconducting coaxial lines
These cables send signals to and from qubits, like a coaxial line for a cable television. The superconducting lines are zero-loss, meaning they can transmit information without losing energy.
  * ### Magnetic Shield
Electromagnetic signals like those from your phone create noise in a quantum system. This shield protects our systems from the interference of this kind of radiation. It’s particularly effective at the ultra-low temperatures in which we operate.
  * ### Quantum limited amplifiers
Quantum-limited amplifiers (QLAs) boost the faint readout signals that come from sensitive quantum processors while adding the minimum amount of noise allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics.
  * ### Quantum processors
IBM Quantum Heron is a 156-qubit processor designed for performance and the basis of our plan to scale quantum computers. Heron contains the qubit and gate technology that forms the foundation of our development roadmap.

## Explore our family of processors
Continual hardware progress ensures our users have access to the highest-performing QPUs available. Today, IBM quantum computers include our 127-qubit Eagle, 133-qubit Heron r1, and 156-qubit Heron r2 and r3 processors.
At 127 qubits, the Eagle processor features breakthrough packaging technologies for enhanced qubit control and scalability.

## Creating systems that scale
The era of advantage will require the execution of a large number of circuits in a reliable and predictable way. To deliver this performance and stability, we deploy our most advanced quantum hardware architectures in global quantum data centers.
##### IBM Quantum System Two
IBM Quantum System Two is the cornerstone of quantum-centric supercomputing. Its flexible design allows multiple QPUs to be linked in a data center environment.
##### Modular and configurable
These systems combine scalable cryogenic infrastructure and classical runtime servers with modular qubit control electronics to facilitate hybrid architectures.
