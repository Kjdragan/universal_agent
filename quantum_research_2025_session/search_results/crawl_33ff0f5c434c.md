Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:
  * For years, companies like Google and various Chinese research outfits have claimed to have achieved “quantum supremacy”—the ability of a quantum computer to complet a computational task that’s impossible for a classical computer to achieve. 
  * Experts have cast doubt on these claims, but now, a team has achieved what they call “unconditional” quantum information supremacy. 
  * There are still huge barriers to making fault-tolerant quantum computers that will unlock a new era of computing.

Spend an afternoon reading about quantum computing, and it won’t take long until you stumble across the term “quantum supremacy.” While this is quite a lofty-sounding boast, the idea is relatively simple: If a a quantum computer—with its useful qubits in superposition—can do calculations that would be impossible (or hugely impractical) for a classical supercomputer to do, it has achieved quantum supremacy. 
Google first tried to claim the supremacy crown back in 2019, and researchers in China argued the same a year later. But in both cases, experts weren’t so sure if true supremacy had been achieved. In Google’s case, its Sycamore quantum computer completed a task in three minutes and 20 seconds that the company said would take a classical computer 10,000 years to complete. 
However, in 2024, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in China completed the task in 14 seconds using an impressively-powerful-but-undeniably-classical supercomputer. 
As _New Scientist_ notes, proving supremacy is notoriously difficult because you need to be sure that classical algorithms could never solve the task placed upon the quantum computer in question—and it seems that scientists at the University of Texas at Austin have _finally_ pulled it off. 
In a study published on the preprint server _arXiv_, the U.S.-based research team led by scientists at UT Austin report that they’ve successfully demonstrated “unconditional separation” between quantum and classical computers. 
“A longstanding goal in quantum information science is to demonstrate quantum computations that cannot be feasibly reproduced on a classical computer,” the authors wrote. “We construct a task for which the most space-efficient classical algorithm provably requires between 62 and 382 bits of memory, and solve it using only 12 qubits[…]. This form of quantum advantage—which we call quantum information supremacy—represents a new benchmark in quantum computing, one that does not rely on unproven conjectures.”
In the experiment, the quantum computer used qubits made from ions and controlled by lasers. Instead of creating some immensely complex calculation, the researchers focused on something a bit smaller. The aim was to show that a quantum device could solve a task using significantly fewer qubits than a classical computer would use classical bits.
Assigning ends of the system the standard experimental nicknames of Alice and Bob, the task required Alice to create a quantum state and Bob measure that state to understand its properties. The quantum computer then optimized this procedure until Bob’s output could be predicted before Alice revealed its state, reports to _New Scientist_ state. 
While a quantum computer required only 12 qubits to complete this task, the authors noted that a classical computer would need somewhere between 62 and 382 bits to perform the same task—undeniable evidence of quantum information supremacy. 
“Unlike prior demonstrations of quantum advantage that rely on unproven complexity assumptions, our result is provable and permanent: no future development in classical algorithms can close this gap.” the authors wrote. 
Although this is good to know, scientists already had a sneaking suspicion that quantum computing would eventually outshine its classical counterpart due to the superposition properties of qubits. The real work moving forward will be building fault-tolerant quantum computers with more than 1,000 qubits—and, excitingly, things are progressing. 
In a paper published this week in the journal _Nature_ , Harvard scientists successfully demonstrated a coherent 3,000 qubit computer with new methods of error correction.
With quantum supremacy verifiably achieved, the work continues to make the promise of these futuristic computers a reality.
