  "content": "THE SEAGULL OF STILHAVEN\n\nBy Simone\n\n---\n\nThe fog had not lifted over Stilhaven Bay for three days when the seagull arrived.\n\nHe was not like the others\u2014the scrabbling, sharp-beaned horde that fought over chip wrappers and bait scraps. This gull was larger, his feathers a startling alabaster against the gray slate sky. His beak, stained the color of sunset, hooked with a precision that suggested he could crack open secrets as easily as clams.\n\nThe locals noticed him first.\n\nOld Bram, who had manned the bait shop for forty-seven years, watched the gull perch on the piling each morning at exactly 6:04 AM. Not 6:03. Not 6:05. 6:04.\n\n\"He's waiting for something,\" Bram said, his voice like gravel in a tin can.\n\nThe gull would stand there, one leg tucked into his breast feathers, head cocked toward the horizon. And he would wait.\n\nThe children of Stilhaven named him Admiral. They would leave offerings\u2014shiny pebbles, feathers, once a plastic pirate's gold coin\u2014and the Admiral would accept each tribute with a solemn dip of his beak. No squawking. No scrambling. Just quiet acceptance.\n\nOn the seventh day, the fog broke.\n\nWhat emerged from the mist was not a fishing trawler, not a Coast Guard cutter, but a single wooden dory, drifting aimlessly, its sail shredded, its hull painted in colors that didn't exist in any harbor the locals had ever seen.\n\nThe Admiral launched himself from his piling.\n\nHe flew to the dory, circled it three times, then landed on the gunwale. Inside, a single child slept, curled around a leather-bound book, her hair the color of summer wheat.\n\nBram was already rowing out to meet them, his arthritic knuckles white around the oars. He reached the dory just as the child stirred. Her eyes opened\u2014blue, with flecks of gold that matched the morning sun.\n\nThe Admiral hopped down from the gunwale and stood between them, his wings half-spread, as if in benediction.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said the child.\n\n\"You've got a friend,\" was all Bram could say.\n\nThe child smiled. \"He found me.\"\n\n\"Found you?\"\n\n\"In the fog. When I was scared.\" She stroked the Admiral's head, and he leaned into her touch with the familiarity of an old companion. \"He showed me the way.\"\n\nBram looked at the shattered sail, the foreign harbor painted on the hull, the child who spoke no accent he recognized.\n\n\"Where did you come from, then?\"\n\nThe child considered this, turning the question over in her mind as if it were a smooth stone she'd found on the beach.\n\n\"I don't remember,\" she said at last. \"But I think I was going somewhere important.\"\n\nThe Admiral made a sound then\u2014not a squawk, but a low, resonant call that seemed to echo off the fog banks still lingering at the mouth of the bay.\n\n\"He says we're here now,\" the child translated.\n\nBram looked at the bird, really looked at him, and noticed for the first time that the Admiral's eyes were not the dark bead-black of ordinary gulls. They were amber. They were ancient.\n\nThey were knowing.\n\n\"Well,\" Bram said, after a long moment. \"I suppose 'here' is as good a place as any.\"\n\nHe extended a calloused hand. The child took it, and together\u2014with the Admiral circling overhead\u2014they brought the strange dory to shore.\n\nAnd that, the locals would later say, was how Stilhaven gained its second mystery.\n\nThe first was the fog.\n\nThe second was the girl who arrived with the sunrise, and the gull who had been waiting for her all along.\n\n---\n[END]"
