While the other hens in Sunflower Farm were content to peck at corn and cluck about the weather, Barnaby spent his nights gazing upward.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" asked Clara, the oldest hen, peering over her spectacles.\n\n\"The moon,\" Barnaby replied dreamily. \"I want to touch it.\"\n\nThe other chickens laughed. \"Don't be ridiculous, Barnaby,\" crowed Rooster Rufus. \"Chickens don't fly to the moon. Chickens barely fly at all!\"\n\nBut Barnaby was determined. He spent weeks training, flapping his wings vigorously every morning until he could hover several inches above the ground for nearly three seconds. The other hens stopped laughing and started watching with mild concern.\n\nOne evening, as the full moon rose\u2014a glowing orb of silver that seemed close enough to peck\u2014Barnaby climbed to the top of the farmhouse roof.\n\n\"Barnaby, come down!\" called Clara. \"You'll hurt yourself!\"\n\nBarnaby took a deep breath. \"Tonight, I touch the moon.\"\n\nHe leaped.\n\nFor a glorious moment, Barnaby soared higher than any chicken in history. He flapped with all his might, feathers straining against the air. The moon seemed to grow larger, brighter, calling to him...\n\nThen gravity remembered Barnaby existed.\n\nHe tumbled downward, flapping frantically, and landed in a soft pile of hay behind the barn. Unhurt but thoroughly humbled, Barnaby looked up at the moon, still impossibly distant.\n\nA shadow moved beside him. It was Rufus, the rooster.\n\n\"You flew further than any chicken I've ever seen,\" Rufus said quietly.\n\n\"But I didn't reach the moon,\" Barnaby sighed.\n\n\"No,\" Rufus agreed. \"But you made us all look up.\"\n\nAnd that night, for the first time, all the chickens of Sunflower Farm gathered in the yard to watch the moon together, dreaming of impossible things.\n\nSometimes reaching for the moon isn't about touching it\u2014it's about teaching others to look up.\n\n***\n\n\u2014 Generated by Simone, your Universal Agent",
