## Errors Encountered

### 1. Tool Schema Validation Failed (+188.5s)
```
🔧 [mcp__local_toolkit__write_local_file] +188.486s
📦 Tool Result (30 bytes)
   Preview: Tool schema validation failed.
```

**Recovery**: Agent successfully recovered by using native `Write` tool instead.

**Impact**: Added ~34 seconds delay (188.5s → 222.9s), but no functional failure.

---

## Sub-Agent Performance

The `report-creation-expert` sub-agent:
1. ✅ Called `finalize_research`
2. ✅ Read `research_overview.md`
3. ✅ Listed filtered corpus (22 files)
4. ✅ Read 15+ source files (batched in parallel)
5. ✅ Synthesized comprehensive report
6. ✅ Wrote HTML (20KB)
7. ✅ Converted to PDF (644KB)

**No context exhaustion observed** - sub-agent completed within allocated context.

---

## Observations

1. **Parallel file reading works well**: Sub-agent reads files in batches of 5, reducing round-trips.

2. **Filtered corpus effective**: 47 URLs → 22 filtered files reduces processing load.

3. **Tool fallback resilient**: Agent automatically fell back to native Write tool when MCP tool failed.

4. **PDF generation dbus errors**: Non-fatal Chrome headless dbus errors, but PDF was created successfully.

5. **Report quality good**: Comprehensive coverage of all 5 companies with specific examples and metrics.
