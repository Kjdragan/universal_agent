THEIR STORY 
##  Helping clients extract objective analyses from complex documents and records 
Case-Based Research (CBR) is a pseudonym for a successful SaaS company that uses AI and machine learning (ML) to extract salient details from multiple document types and create objective research reports. 
! 
##  THEIR GOAL 
##  Automate the most difficult research cases with Generative AI 
Research is a challenging, time-consuming task for human experts. A thorough manual review of a single research case can take hours of an expert’s time. 
The CBR platform automates research services for millions of cases a month. A machine learning model handled 98% of research cases, but the remaining 2% were too complex to process, leaving clients with tens of thousands of cases to review by hand. 
Even expert professionals struggled to review these outlying cases, which could have more than 230 distinct data categories and noisy documentation. The team hoped large language models could do the job within CBR’s budget and SLAs. 
##  THEIR SOLUTION 
##  Fine-tuned Llama cracked the hardest research cases 
CBR repowered its platform with a fine-tuned Llama 3 8B Instruct model. The model reached 90% accuracy on the most difficult research cases, outperforming the leading 4th generation LLM in accuracy and response times. By using a lightweight, small language model (SLM), CBR met their platform’s low-latency SLAs with far less computing overhead and far lower costs than a commercial model.

During evaluation, fine-tuned Llama 2 7B delivered 9.4% higher accuracy and 30x faster response times than the leading 4th generation LLM 
##  THEIR APPROACH 
##  Predibase delivers fine-tuned models at scale 
CBR used Predibase for training and production. The platform uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to deliver fine-tuned performance without retraining the entire model. This technique drastically reduces training time and computing overhead in production. 
After fine-tuning on a 150,000-row dataset, Llama 3 8B Instruct delivered 90% accuracy in production and maintained 0.15 sec response times under full-scale traffic loads.

CBR uses increasingly sophisticated classification services to process information efficiently. 
##  THEIR SUCCESS 
##  Llama delivers fast, objective analysis for complex research cases 
With Llama 3 8B Instruct and the Predibase platform, CBR has automated its most difficult research cases, saving clients hours of expert labor and ensuring that complex research cases receive thorough, unbiased reviews. 
**Projected results:**
**• 97%+** accuracy on the easiest 98% research cases
**• 90%+** accuracy on the most difficult 2% of research cases
**• 5x** faster onboarding for semiconductor professionals
**• 30x** faster response times in production versus the leading 4th generation LLM tests
