## Upcoming Blue Origin Launches
Amazon Leo (New Glenn #1)
!Blue Origin logo
Blue Origin
TBD
2026
📍 Cape Canaveral Space Force Station
🚀 New Glenn
🎯 Low Earth Orbit
Amazon Leo, formerly known as Project Kuiper, is a mega constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit that will offer broadband internet access, this constellation will be managed by Kuiper Systems LLC, a subsidiary of Amazon. This constellation is planned to be composed of 3,276 satellites. The satellites are projected to be placed in 98 orbital planes in three orbital layers, one at 590 km, 610 km and 630 km altitude. 61 satellites will be carried on each New Glenn launch.
Last Update: NET mid-2026.
Blue Moon Pathfinder

2026
📍 Cape Canaveral Space Force Station
🚀 New Glenn
🎯 Low Earth Orbit
First flight of Blue Origin's Blue Moon MK1 lunar lander.
Last Update: Moved back to NET 2026 based on lander integration and testing progress.
BlueBird Block 2 #4

Blue Origin
TBD
2026
📍 Cape Canaveral Space Force Station
🚀 New Glenn
🎯 Low Earth Orbit
AST SpaceMobile’s Block 2 BlueBird satellites are designed to deliver up to 10 times the bandwidth capacity of the BlueBird Block 1 satellites, required to achieve 24/7 continuous cellular broadband service coverage in the United States, with beams designed to support a capacity of up to 40 MHz, enabling peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbps, supporting voice, full data and video applications. The Block 2 BlueBirds, featuring as large as 2400 square foot communications arrays, will be the largest satellites ever commercially deployed in Low Earth orbit once launched. This launch will feature 8 satellites.

Blue Moon Pathfinder Mission 2 & VIPER
!Blue Origin logo
Blue Origin
TBD
2027
📍 Cape Canaveral Space Force Station
🚀 New Glenn
🎯 Low Earth Orbit
2nd of the National Team’s Blue Moon MK1 lunar lander test missions to validate the necessary technologies for its HLS lunar module. Some of the life support hardware will travel on this mission in preparation for the first crew Blue Moon flight. This mission will also carry NASA’s VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) lunar rover. VIPER is designed to explore the relatively nearby but extreme environment of the Moon in search of ice and other potential resources. This mobile robot will land at the South Pole of the Moon on a 100-day mission, in order to teach us about the origin and distribution of water on the Moon and help determine how we can harvest the Moon's resources for future human space exploration. VIPER is designed to roam the Moon using its three instruments and a 1 meter long drill to detect and analyze various lunar soil environments at a range of depths and temperatures. The rover can venture into permanently shadowed craters, some of the coldest spots in the solar system, where ice reserves have endured for billions of years. The rover was originally slated to launch on Astrobotic’s Griffin Mission One lunar lander (with the Falcon Heavy rocket), but the VIPER mission was cancelled in July 2024 due to budget cuts. After consulting with the industry to find alternative ways to deliver the rover to the lunar surface, NASA ultimately chose to launch it with Blue Origin’s 2nd Blue Moon MK1 lander mission.
