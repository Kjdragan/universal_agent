## GenAI
#### LLM Fine-Tuning
Label data for supervised fine-tuning or refine models using RLHF
#### LLM Evaluations
Response moderation, grading, and side-by-side comparison
#### RAG Evaluation
Use Ragas scores and human feedback
Quick Start

## Computer Vision
#### Image Classification
Put images into categories
#### Object Detection
Detect objects on image, boxes, polygons, circular, and keypoints supported
#### Semantic Segmentation
Partition image into multiple segments. Use ML models to pre-label and optimize the process
Quick Start

## Audio & Speech Applications
#### Classification
Put audio into categories
#### Speaker Diarization
Partition an input audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the speaker identity
#### Emotion Recognition
Tag and identify emotion from the audio
#### Audio Transcription
Write down verbal communication in text
Quick Start

## NLP, Documents, Chatbots, Transcripts
#### Classification
Classify document into one or multiple categories. Use taxonomies of up to 10000 classes
#### Named Entity
Extract and put relevant bits of information into pre-defined categories
#### Question Answering
Answer questions based on context
#### Sentiment Analysis
Determine whether a document is positive, negative or neutral
Quick Start

## Robots, Sensors, IoT Devices
#### Classification
Put time series into categories
#### Segmentation
Identify regions relevant to the activity type you're building your ML algorithm for
#### Event Recognition
Label single events on plots of time series data
Quick Start

## Multi-Domain Applications
#### Dialogue Processing
Call center recording can be simultaneously transcribed and processed as text
#### Optical Character Recognition
Put an image and text right next to each other
#### Time Series with Reference
Use video or audio streams to easier segment time series data
Quick Start

## Video
#### Classification
Put videos into categories
#### Object Tracking
Label and track multiple objects frame-by-frame
#### Assisted Labeling
Add keyframes and automatically interpolate bounding boxes between keyframes
Quick Start

### Flexible and configurable
Configurable layouts and templates adapt to your dataset and workflow.
### Integrate with your ML/AI pipeline
Webhooks, Python SDK and API allow you to authenticate, create projects, import tasks, manage model predictions, and more.
### ML-assisted labeling
Save time by using predictions to assist your labeling process with ML backend integration.
### Connect your cloud storage
Connect to cloud object storage and label data there directly with S3 and GCP.
### Explore & understand your data
Prepare and manage your dataset in our Data Manager using advanced filters.
### Multiple projects and users
Support multiple projects, use cases and data types in one platform.
