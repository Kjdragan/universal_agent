## Science
NASA Science seeks to discover the secrets of the universe, search for life elsewhere, and protect and improve life on Earth and in space. The agency’s science missions circle the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, Mars, and many other destinations within our solar system, including spacecraft that look out even further into our universe.

## Human Spaceflight
Human space exploration addresses fundamental questions about our place in the universe and the history of our solar system. NASA’s exploration vision is anchored in providing value for humanity by answering some of the most fundamental questions: Why are we here? How did it all begin? Are we alone? What comes next?

## Aeronautics
Building on a legacy of aeronautical research that can trace its origins to the earliest days of powered, heavier-than-air flight, NASA remains committed to transforming aviation by dramatically reducing its environmental impact, improving efficiency while maintaining safety, and paving the way to revolutionary aircraft shapes and propulsion that opens new possibilities for commercial air travel.

## Space Technology
Technology demonstrations enable NASA to mature the cutting-edge, laboratory-proven technologies and new capabilities that will transform future science and space exploration goals. Through these missions, ground-based or in-space testing is conducted to determine the feasibility of technologies and systems for use in NASA missions, for other government agencies, and with the commercial space industry.

## Artemis II
Four astronauts will venture around the Moon on Artemis II, the first crewed mission on NASA's path to establishing a long-term presence at the Moon for science and exploration through Artemis. The 10-day flight will help confirm systems and hardware needed for early human lunar exploration missions.

## In the Beginning
NASA's first high profile program was Project Mercury, an effort to learn if humans could survive in space. 
In October 1958, just six days after NASA formally organized, America’s first human spaceflight program was born. Project Mercury’s manned flights spanned just two years – from May 1961 to May 1963 – making history with its six missions launched from Cape Canaveral.
