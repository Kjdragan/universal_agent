NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) are looking at a likely launch date in March 2025 for the NISAR satellite. Short for NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar, NISAR will scan nearly all of Earth’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days to measure changes in the planet’s ecosystems, its land and sea ice, and its solid Earth. The NISAR satellite will launch from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India’s southeastern coast.
