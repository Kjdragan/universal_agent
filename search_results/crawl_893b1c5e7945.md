As lunar operations grow in frequency and complexity, so does the need for credible, accessible data. The Lunar Ledger offers a neutral, open-access database where missions can be registered and activities tracked, helping reduce risks, avoid site conflicts, and build trust across the sector.
Incubated under Open Lunar as the Lunar Registry, the Lunar Ledger is the result of deep collaboration with more than 300 stakeholders from across the lunar sector.

A giant leap in orbital imagery is what we need to realize advanced Moon missions
Lunar News
NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has long been the foundation of lunar exploration, but its aging systems leave a growing data gap for future missions. Despite scientific calls for a successor, NASA hasn’t approved one, leaving newer international and commercial orbiters to fill the void. There is an urge for coordinated global efforts to share data and create a network of orbiters to better support upcoming Moon missions.

The case for India and China to exchange lunar samples from Chang’e and Chandrayaan
Lunar News
India’s upcoming Chandrayaan-4 mission aims to return lunar samples from the Moon’s south pole, positioning the country to join the global community of sample-return missions led recently by China’s Chang’e program. The article discusses how scientists could actively engage in studying Chang’e samples now, both to gain scientific benefits and to prepare for international collaboration and potential sample exchanges once Chandrayaan-4 succeeds.
