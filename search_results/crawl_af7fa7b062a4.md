Recently, I’ve been involved in projects related to instruction tuning for large language models(LLMs). I felt it was time to summarize some insights and experiences from this work.
This article, presented in a Q&A format, explores key concepts and considerations in instruction tuning, focusing on eight areas:
  * Instruction Tuning for LLMs: What and Why?
  * Instruction-Tuning Data: Quality or Quantity?
  * How to Ensure High-Quality Data?
  * Data Diversity vs. Quality: Which is More Important?
  * How to Ensure Data Diversity?
  * How to Prevent Task-Specific Fine-Tuning from Compromising General Instruction-Following?
  * Which Instruction-Tuning Method Should We Choose for a Specific Task?
  * What Details Should be Noted Regarding Fine-Tuning?
