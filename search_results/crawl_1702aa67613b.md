# Extreme Speed and Scale for DL TrainingPermalink
**_DeepSpeed enabled the world’s most powerful language models (at the time of this writing) such as MT-530B and BLOOM_**. DeepSpeed offers a confluence of system innovations, that has made large scale DL training effective, and efficient, greatly improved ease of use, and redefined the DL training landscape in terms of scale that is possible. These innovations include ZeRO, 3D-Parallelism, DeepSpeed-MoE, ZeRO-Infinity, etc.
# DeepSpeed AdoptionPermalink
DeepSpeed has been used to train many different large-scale models. Below is a list of several examples that we are aware of (if you’d like to include your model please submit a PR):
  * Megatron-Turing NLG (530B)
  * Jurassic-1 (178B)
  * BLOOM (176B)
  * GLM (130B)
  * YaLM (100B)
  * GPT-NeoX (20B)
  * AlexaTM (20B)
  * Turing NLG (17B
  * METRO-LM (5.4B)

DeepSpeed has been integrated with several different popular open-source DL frameworks such as:
Documentation

 | Transformers with DeepSpeed  
 | Accelerate with DeepSpeed  
 | Lightning with DeepSpeed  
 | MosaicML with DeepSpeed  
DeepSpeed is an integral part of Microsoft’s AI at Scale initiative to enable next-generation AI capabilities at scale.
