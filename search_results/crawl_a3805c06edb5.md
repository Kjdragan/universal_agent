AAA Air Support is a manufacturer and stocking distributor of quality raw materials including Roll Form Stringers and Aluminum Extrusions, as well many other Aluminum, Steel and Titanium products pertinent to the Aerospace Industry.
Does your company have AOG requirements for raw materials? AAA Air Support specializes in solving buyer’s problems with quick turnarounds on requirements for Roll Form Sections, Aircraft Extrusions, Sheet, Plate, Bar and Tube. Throughout our 7,500 square foot warehouse located near LAX Los Angeles airport, our inventory is stocked with diverse raw materials to support your most crucial requirements that can be shipped both domestic and international, for all repair and maintenance facilities.
Whether you need 100 feet of Aluminum Extrusion or 2 feet of Stainless Steel tubing, we will ship out quickly and efficiently providing your company with the means to get that airplane out of the hangar and back in the air. No quantity is too small or large & all materials come certified with a certificate of conformance or test reports.
Our state of the art production facility is located in the airplane manufacturing capital of the world, Wichita, Kansas. We produce roll form sections also known as “stringers.” We have the capability to fabricate a variety of different shapes and sizes including simple Angles, U channels, Z/C shapes as well as Hat sections. Large or small, we invite all airline manufacturing contractors to take advantage of our expertise in high quality rolled sections.
Some of our larger customers are Spirit AeroSystems, Korean Aerospace Industries and Turkish Aerospace Industries, often supporting jobs for Boeing Commercial Aircraft. Whether you are a fellow distributor of raw materials, an airline or perhaps an export company, our objective is to provide quality products at a fair price and the best delivery possible.
